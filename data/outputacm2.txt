#!Whether you're frustrated with current PC offerings (and their inflated prices) or are simply looking for a cool project to take on, building a computer from the ground up using off-the-shelf parts can offer significant advantages. In these pages, computer dudes Darrel Wayne Creacy and Carlito Vicencio outline those advantages and then show you how to build the computer of your dreams. The pair begins by explaining what components make up a PC and what you need to think about when selecting those components, before helping you determine your needs and suggesting various configurations to fit those uses. Breaking the process down into its simplest terms, the authors provide component lists for a number of different PC setups: for students, home users, multimedia/home-theater enthusiasts, high-end graphic/video/audio producers, and more. Using plain language and plenty of visual and instructional aids--photos, illustrations, diagrams, step-by-step directions, and more--the authors ensure that even someone (like you!) who knows nothing about technology can build the perfect PC! On a more personal note, the authors are donating a percentage of their income from this book to the Breast Cancer Research Foundationï¾to thank all the women in their lives who have supported them and battled the disease.

#!Kullback-Leibler divergence and the Neyman-Pearson lemma are two fundamental concepts in statistics. Both are about likelihood ratios: Kullback-Leibler divergence is the expected log-likelihood ratio, and the Neyman-Pearson lemma is about error rates of likelihood ratio tests. Exploring this connection gives another statistical interpretation of the Kullback-Leibler divergence in terms of the loss of power of the likelihood ratio test when the wrong distribution is used for one of the hypotheses. In this interpretation, the standard non-negativity property of the Kullback-Leibler divergence is essentially a restatement of the optimal property of likelihood ratios established by the Neyman-Pearson lemma. The asymmetry of Kullback-Leibler divergence is overviewed in information geometry.

#!Motivation: Experimental techniques in proteomics have seen rapid development over the last few years. Volume and complexity of the data have both been growing at a similar rate. Accordingly, data management and analysis are one of the major challenges in proteomics. Flexible algorithms are required to handle changing experimental setups and to assist in developing and validating new methods. In order to facilitate these studies, it would be desirable to have a flexible 'toolbox' of versatile and user-friendly applications allowing for rapid construction of computational workflows in proteomics. Results: We describe a set of tools for proteomics data analysis---TOPP, The OpenMS Proteomics Pipeline. TOPP provides a set of computational tools which can be easily combined into analysis pipelines even by non-experts and can be used in proteomics workflows. These applications range from useful utilities (file format conversion, peak picking) over wrapper applications for known applications (e.g. Mascot) to completely new algorithmic techniques for data reduction and data analysis. We anticipate that TOPP will greatly facilitate rapid prototyping of proteomics data evaluation pipelines. As such, we describe the basic concepts and the current abilities of TOPP and illustrate these concepts in the context of two example applications: the identification of peptides from a raw dataset through database search and the complex analysis of a standard addition experiment for the absolute quantitation of biomarkers. The latter example demonstrates TOPP's ability to construct flexible analysis pipelines in support of complex experimental setups. Availability: The TOPP components are available as open-source software under the lesser GNU public license (LGPL).

#!The Internet is bigger and better than what a mere browser allows. Webbots, Spiders, and Screen Scrapers is for programmers and businesspeople who want to take full advantage of the vast resources available on the Web. There's no reason to let browsers limit your online experience-especially when you can easily automate online tasks to suit your individual needs. Learn how to write webbots and spiders that do all this and more: Programmatically download entire websites Effectively parse data from web pages Manage cookies Decode encrypted files Automate form submissions Send and receive email Send SMS alerts to your cell phone Unlock password-protected websites Automatically bid in online auctions Exchange data with FTP and NNTP servers Sample projects using standard code libraries reinforce these new skills. You'll learn how to create your own webbots and spiders that track online prices, aggregate different data sources into a single web page, and archive the online data you just can't live without. You'll learn inside information from an experienced webbot developer on how and when to write stealthy webbots that mimic human behavior, tips for developing fault-tolerant designs, and various methods for launching and scheduling webbots. You'll also get advice on how to write webbots and spiders that respect website owner property rights, plus techniques for shielding websites from unwanted robots. As a bonus, visit the author's website to test your webbots on sample target pages, and to download the scripts and code libraries used in the book. Some tasks are just too tedious-or too important!- to leave to humans. Once you've automated your online life, you'll never let a browser limit the way you use the Internet again.

#!We consider a problem motivated by the desire to provide flexible, rate-based, quality of service guarantees for packets sent over input queued switches and switch networks. Our focus is solving a type of online traffic scheduling problem, whose input at each time step is a set of desired traffic rates through the switch network. These traffic rates in general cannot be exactly achieved since they assume arbitrarily small fractions of packets can be transmitted at each time step. The goal of the traffic scheduling problem is to closely approximate the given sequence of traffic rates by a sequence of transmissions in which only whole packets are sent. We prove worst-case bounds on the additional buffer use, which we call backlog, that results from using such an approximation.We first consider the N × N, input queued, crossbar switch. Our main result is an online packet-scheduling algorithm using no speedup that guarantees backlog at most (N+1)2/4 packets at each input port and each output port. Upper bounds on worst-case backlog have been proved for the case of constant fluid schedules, such as the N2-2N+2 bound of Chang, Chen, and Huang (INFOCOM, 2000). Our main result for the crossbar switch is the first, to our knowledge, to bound backlog in terms of switch size N for arbitrary, time-varying fluid schedules, without using speedup.Our main result for Banyan networks is an exact characterization of the speedup required to maintain bounded backlog, in terms of polytopes derived from the network topology.

#!The field of supply chain management has been growing at a rapid pace in recent years, both as a research area and as a practical discipline. In this paper, we study the computational complexity of product covering problems in 3-tier supply chain models, and present natural complete problems for the classes W[3] and W[4] in parameterized complexity theory. This seems the first group of natural complete problems for higher levels in the parameterized intractability hierarchy (i.e., the W-hierarchy), and the first precise complexity characterizations of certain optimization problems in the research of supply chain management. Our results also derive strong computational lower bounds and inapproximability for these optimization problems.

#!To simulate adaptive agents with abilities matching those of their real-world counterparts, a natural approach is to incorporate adaptation mechanisms such as classical conditioning into agent-based simulation. Existing models for adaptation mechanisms are usually based on quantitative methods such as DST. In contrast, agent-based simulation is usually based on qualitative, logical languages. To bridge this gap, this paper puts forward an integrative approach to simulate and analyse the conditioning process of an adaptive agent, which integrates quantitative and qualitative aspects within one temporal specification language. The approach comprises (1) simulation of adaptation mechanisms in an executable language, (2) automated analysis of dynamic properties against simulation traces, and (3) verification of representation relations for internal agent states against simulation traces. Furthermore, the approach addresses the issue of realism of intermediate states in a simulated conditioning process.
