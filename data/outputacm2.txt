#!As the United States' Army attempts to spiral future force technologies into the current force, realistic representations of network-centric warfare become a priority for modeling and simulation (M&S). Specifically, future communications systems will provide different performance and capabilities than current systems, and these new capabilities need to be represented by the Army's M&S. In order to enable realistic analysis, the new communications systems models will need to be loaded by realistic representations of traffic flows to ensure the accuracy of the command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance (C4ISR) analysis results. This paper will present a design approach and a series of algorithms to implement implicit traffic in the Future Combat Systems (FCS) Simulation Environment (FSE). The paper will focus on a phased approach for the generation of implicit traffic that will realistically load the modeled communications networks as the level of explicit traffic within the simulation environment increases from a small percentage to a large percentage of overall traffic.

#!Using silhouettes in uncontrolled environments typically requires handling occlusions as well as changing or cluttered backgrounds, which limits the applicability of most silhouette based methods. For the purpose of 3-D shape modeling, we show that representing generic 3-D surfaces as implicit surfaces lets us effectively address these issues.This desirable behavior is completely independent from the way the surface deformations are parame-trized. To show this, we demonstrate our technique in three very different cases: Modeling the deformations of a piece of paper represented by an ordinary triangulated mesh; reconstruction and tracking a person's shoulders whose deformations are expressed in terms of Dirichlet Free Form Deformations; reconstructing the shape of a human face parametrized in terms of a Principal Component Analysis model.

#!A central problem in personal communication systems is to optimize bandwidth usage, while providing Quality of Service (QoS) guarantees to mobile users. Network mobility management, and in particular, location management, consumes a significant portion of bandwidth, which is a necessary overhead for supporting mobile users. We focus our efforts on minimizing this overhead. Unlike previous works, we concentrate on optimizing existing schemes, and so the algorithms we present are easily incorporated into current networks. We present the first polynomial time approximation algorithms for minimum bandwidth location management. In planar graphs, our algorithm provably generates a solution that uses no more than a constant factor more bandwidth than the optimal solution. In general graphs, our algorithm provably generates a solution that uses just a factor O(log n) more bandwidth than optimal where n is the number of base stations in the network. We show that, in practice, our algorithm produces near-optimal results and outperforms other schemes that are described in the literature. For the important case of the line graph, we present a polynomial-time optimal algorithm. Finally, we illustrate that our algorithm can also be used for optimizing the handoff mechanism.

#!We propose a logistic regression method based on the hybridation of a linear model and product-unit neural network models for binary classification. In a first step we use an evolutionary algorithm to determine the basic structure of the product-unit model and afterwards we apply logistic regression in the new space of the derived features. This hybrid model has been applied to seven benchmark data sets and a new microbiological problem. The hybrid model outperforms the linear part and the nonlinear part obtaining a good compromise between them and they perform well compared to several other learning classification techniques. We obtain a binary classifier with very promising results in terms of classification accuracy and the complexity of the classifier.

#!We present an efficient algorithm for approximating huge general volumetric data sets, i.e. the data is given over arbitrarily shaped volumes and consists of up to millions of samples. The method is based on cubic trivariate splines, i.e. piecewise polynomials of total degree three defined w.r.t, uniform type-6 tetrahedral partitions of the volumetric domain. Similar as in the recent bivariate approximation approaches (cf. [10, 15]), the splines in three variables are automatically determined from the discrete data as a result of a two-step method (see [40]), where local discrete least squares polynomial approximations of varying degrees are extended by using natural conditions, i.e. the continuity and smoothness properties which determine the underlying spline space. The main advantages of this approach with linear algorithmic complexity are as follows: no tetrahedral partition of the volume data is needed, only small linear systems have to be solved, the local variation and distribution of the data is automatically adapted, Bernstein-B&eacute;zier techniques well-known in Computer Aided Geometric Design (CAGD) can be fully exploited, noisy data are automatically smoothed. Our numerical examples with huge data sets for synthetic data as well as some real-world data confirm the efficiency of the methods, show the high quality of the spline approximation, and illustrate that the rendered iso-surfaces inherit a visual smooth appearance from the volume approximating splines.

#!Medicine, engineering, and finance are traditional fields for the application of Fuzzy Logic (FL); however, in social sciences, the utilization of FL can be intensely explored as a valuable analysis instrument. Joining fuzzy with Multiple Criteria Decision Making (MCDM), the natural complex and uncertain criteria of social problems can be adequately explored. A suitable uncertainty analysis is the focal point in the social field. In this direction, an intelligent computational method for election forecasting is proposed as a practical result of this research. The main objective is to present a more flexible methodology for political assessment comparing to traditional methods.

#!A new approach is proposed for reconstructing 3D lines and cameras from 2D corresponding lines across multiple uncalibrated views. There is no requirement that the 2D corresponding lines on different images represent the same segment of a 3D line, which may not appear on all images. A 3D line is reconstructed by minimizing a geometric cost function that measures the distance of the reprojected end points of the 3D segment from the measured 2D lines on different images. An algorithmic procedure is provided with guaranteed convergence to a solution where the geometric cost function achieves a (local) minimum.

#@Barak Raveh,Ofer Rahat,Ronen Basri,Gideon Schreiber
#t2007
#cBioinformatics
#index888
#!Motivation: Secondary structures are key descriptors of a protein fold and its topology. In recent years, they facilitated intensive computational tasks for finding structural homologues, fold prediction and protein design. Their popularity stems from an appealing regularity in patterns of geometry and chemistry. However, the definition of secondary structures is of subjective nature. An unsupervised de-novo discovery of these structures would shed light on their nature, and improve the way we use these structures in algorithms of structural bioinformatics. Methods: We developed a new method for unsupervised partitioning of undirected graphs, based on patterns of small recurring network motifs. Our input was the network of all H-bonds and covalent interactions of protein backbones. This method can be also used for other biological and non-biological networks. Results: In a fully unsupervised manner, and without assuming any explicit prior knowledge, we were able to rediscover the existence of conventional α-helices, parallel β-sheets, anti-parallel sheets and loops, as well as various non-conventional hybrid structures. The relation between connectivity and crystallographic temperature factors establishes the existence of novel secondary structures.

#!Technology plays an ever-increasing role in our everyday lives. We would like it to be a help rather than a hurdle in our work, particularly in collaborating with others. An emerging problem for both individuals and groups is information spread and neglect, where users have the same copy of the same work, stored on various conventional devices, but no way to keep track of where the most recent version resides. One type of computer support collaborative work application, groupware, tackles this problem, aiming to assist in joint authoring projects, where artifacts such as files, pictures, reports and sound are being gathered to form a whole. Such groupware systems - and we survey seven of them - vary in terms of their functional, architectural, focal, temporal, user involvement and platform dependencies. While we found a wide variety of options for each system, there were also strong commonalities. All of them work with closed communities or groups. There is no public file sharing. All users are aware of all other collaborators in the community and all systems focus on collaboration; not sharing. The comparison includes our own system Nomad, a framework for distributed resource management, with special emphasis placed on the accessibility of information stored on detached devices, such as personal computers, laptops, PDA's and flash-disks. In the comparison, Nomad has advantages of flexibility and temporal independence over the other systems, together with low requirements on the user, and a high level of mobility and platform independence. The contributions of this paper are twofold: we identify and define a specific type of CSCW, groupware, together with a set of criteria for evaluating such systems; and we survey and classify some of the main systems according to the criteria, as well as introducing a custom-designed system, Nomad. From these results, a collaborative group of workers can more easily select a specific groupware that suits its needs. Moreover, designers of new systems will find the commonality factors useful, so they can more easily position their own products.

#!In this paper, we propose a novel variational method for color image segmentation using modified geodesic active contour method. Our goal is to detect Object(s) of Interest (OOI) from a given color image, regardless of other objects. The main novelty of our method is that we modify the stopping function in the functional of usual geodesic active contour method so that the new stopping function is coupled by a discrimination function of OOI. By minimizing the functional, the OOI is segmented. Firstly, we study the pixel properties of the OOI by sample pixels visually chosen from OOI. From these sample pixels, by the principal component analysis and interval estimation, the discrimination function of whether a pixel is in the OOI is obtained probabilistically. Then we propose the energy functional for the segmentation of OOI with new stopping function. Unlike usual stopping functions defined by the image gradient, our improved stopping function depends on not only the image gradient but also the discrimination function derived from the color information of OOI. As a result, better than usual active contour methods which detect all objects in the image, our modified active contour method can detect OOI but without unwanted objects. Experiments are conducted in both synthetic and natural images. The result shows that our algorithm is very efficient for detecting OOI even the background is complicated.

#!We study the problem of image retrieval based on semi-supervised learning. Semi-supervised learning has attracted a lot of attention in recent years. Different from traditional supervised learning. Semi-supervised learning makes use of both labeled and unlabeled data. In image retrieval, collecting labeled examples costs human efforts, while vast amounts of unlabeled data are often readily available and offer some additional information. In this paper, based on support vector machine (SVM), we introduce a semi-supervised learning method for image retrieval. The basic consideration of the method is that, if two data points are close to each, they should share the same label. Therefore, it is reasonable to search a projection with maximal margin and locality preserving property. We compare our method to standard SVM and transductive SVM. Experimental results show efficiency and effectiveness of our method.

#!Soaring health care costs and greater emphasis on preventative medicine have compelled researchers to examine new ways to reduce costs and improve efficiency in outpatient services. Extended waiting times for treatment in the outpatient department followed by short consultations has long been a complaint of patients. This issue is becoming increasingly important in Japan with its progressively aging society. In this context, a discrete event simulation model was developed to examine doctor schedule mixes (DSMs) and various appointment schedules (ASs) in a mixed-patient type environment in an outpatient department of internal medicine of a university hospital. It could identify some of the best DSMs by integrating a simulation model into an optimization program. Combining one DSM found via an optimization program with some ASs, the patient waiting time could be reduced drastically without adding extra resources.

#!In the weak form Galerkin formulation for incompressible flows, the pressure has a well-understood role. At all times, it may be interpreted as a Lagrange multiplier that enforces the divergence-free constraint on the velocity field. This is not the case in least-squares formulations for incompressible flows, where the divergence-free constraint is enforced in a least-squares sense in a variational setting of residual minimization. Thus, the role of the pressure in a least-squares formulation is rather vague. We find that this lack of velocity-pressure coupling in least-squares formulations may induce spurious temporal pressure oscillations when using the non-stationary form of the equations. We present a least-squares formulation with improved velocity-pressure coupling, based on the use of a regularized divergence-free constraint. A first-order system least-squares (FOSLS) approach based on velocity, pressure and vorticity is used to allow the use of practical C0 element expansions in the finite element model. We use high-order spectral element expansions in space and second- and third-order time stepping schemes. Excellent conservation of mass and accuracy of computed pressure metrics are demonstrated in the numerical results.

#index930
#!In this paper, we propose a new region extraction method using chroma key with a two-tone checker pattern background. The method solves the problem in conventional chroma key techniques that foreground objects become transparent if their colors are the same as the background color. The method utilizes the adjacency condition between two-tone regions of the background and the geometrical information of the background grid line. The procedure of the proposed method consists of four steps: 1) background color extraction, 2) background grid line extraction, 3) foreground extraction, and 4) image composition. As to background color extraction, a color space approach is used. As to background grid line extraction, it is difficult to extract background grid line by a color space approach because the color of this region may be a composite of two background colors and different from them. Therefore, the background grid line is extracted from adjacency conditions between two background colors. As to foreground extraction, the boundary between the foreground and the background is detected to recheck the foreground region whose color is same as the background, and the background region whose color is same as the foreground. To detect regions whose colors are same as the background, the adjacency conditions with the background grid line are utilized. As to image composition, the process that smoothes the color of the foreground's boundary against the new background is carried out to create natural images. Experimental results show that the foreground objects can be segmented exactly from the background regardless of the colors of the foreground objects.

#!The PDES literature offers a rich set of techniques for distributed and efficient simulation. However, there is a growing need for simulators that support agent-based applications, and PDES systems are not always well suited for these applications. Example agent-based applications include simulation of biological systems such as ants and bees, multi-robot systems and battlefield simulations. The robotics research community has developed agent-based simulators that provide useful APIs for agent applications. However, such simulators have performance limitations, and they do not scale well. Our approach is to provide middleware between an agent-based API and a PDES simulation kernel. The result is a simulation system that offers an agent-based API for the programmer to a high performance PDES system. Here we describe our design and initial implementation of SASSY, the Scalable Agents Simulation System. We describe our initial implementation and compare the design with related approaches.

#!This paper presents a Time Warp fossil collection mechanism that functions without need for a GVT estimation algorithm. Effectively each Logical Process (LP) collects causality information during normal event execution and then each LP utilizes this information to identify fossils. In this mechanism, LPs use constant size vectors (that are independent of the total number of parallel simulation objects) as timestamps called Plausible Total Clocks to disseminate causality information. For proper operation, this mechanism requires that the communication layer preserves a FIFO ordering on messages. A detailed description of this new fossil collection mechanism and its proof of correctness is presented in this paper.

#!A simple and general-purpose system to recognize biological particles is presented. It is composed of four stages: First (if necessary) promising locations in the image are detected and small regions containing interesting samples are extracted using a feature finder. Second, differential invariants of the brightness are computed at multiple scales of resolution. Third, after point-wise non-linear mappings to a higher dimensional feature space, this information is averaged over the whole region thus producing a vector of features for each sample that is invariant with respect to rotation and translation. Fourth, each sample is classified using a classifier obtained from a mixture-of-Gaussians generative model. This system was developed to classify 12 categories of particles found in human urine; it achieves a 93.2% correct classification rate in this application. It was subsequently trained and tested on a challenging set of images of airborne pollen grains where it achieved an 83% correct classification rate for the three categories found during one month of observation. Pollen classification is challenging even for human experts and this performance is considered good.

#cBioinformatics
#index958
#!Motivation: Functional analyses based on the association of Gene Ontology (GO) terms to genes in a selected gene list are useful bioinformatic tools and the GOstats package has been widely used to perform such computations. In this paper we report significant improvements and extensions such as support for conditional testing. Results: We discuss the capabilities of GOstats, a Bioconductor package written in R, that allows users to test GO terms for over or under-representation using either a classical hypergeometric test or a conditional hypergeometric that uses the relationships among GO terms to decorrelate the results. Availability: GOstats is available as an R package from the Bioconductor project: http://bioconductor.org Contact: sfalcon@fhcrc.org

#!Benefits of migration Planning and implementing a migration project Coexistence and migration tools This IBM Redbook describes why and how to migrate from Microsoft Exchange 5.5 to IBM Lotus Notes and Domino 6. It begins with a discussion of the reasons an organization using Exchange 5.5 would want to move to Domino 6, and describes the benefits that can be gained. It lays out the different options that the organization has for a future messaging infrastructure and discusses the pros and cons of each alternative. It is particularly suited to business and IT managers. The next part is about planning and managing a migration project. It covers how to assess the current messaging environment, design the migration project and future infrastructure, and successfully implement the migration plan. This part is primarily of interest to project managers and IT architects. The rest of the book deals with the technical aspects of moving to a Lotus Notes and Domino 6 messaging environment. Topics covered are: - Coexistence and migration scenarios - Strategies for coexistence during the project - Installation and setup of coexistence and migration tools - How to migrate users and messaging and calendaring information - Public Folder migration and coexistence - Results achieved in the lab using various tools and techniques - Wrapping up a migration project This material is useful for anyone who has to evaluate the tools, install them, and conduct a messaging migration project.

#!The synthesis of increased global competitiveness and the acceptance of commercially available multi purpose database management systems (DBMS) for decision support applications requires an ever more critical system evaluation and selection to be completed in a progressively short period of time. Designers of standard benchmarks, individual customer benchmarks and system stress tests alike are struggling to mastermind queries that are both representative to the real world and execute in a reasonable time. Additionally, the enriched functionality of every new DBMS release amplifies the complexity of today's decision support systems calling for a novel approach in query generation for benchmarks. This paper proposes a framework of so called query evolution rules that can be applied to typical decision support queries, written in SQL92. Deployed in combination with QGEN2, the query generator developed by the TPC for TPC-DS ?[13], these rules quickly turn a small set of queries into a large set of semantically similar queries for ad-hoc benchmarking purposes or they can be used to generate thousands of queries quickly to stress test optimizers or query execution engines without much user intervention.

Initially most effort was directed at building the host processor, EMMY, and its support tools. The next stage was to emulate a variety of instruction sets --- building an archive of emulators. Now we have well over a dozen emulators and can add a new one quickly. A student can emulate a know image architecture in about ten weeks --- twenty weeks includes verification and documentation --- thirty weeks for I/O and interface to a simple operating system. (A student-week is about 6 - 8 hours of effort and corresponds to three units of credit.)

#*A new metric for measuring metamodels quality-of-fit for deterministic simulations

#!Metamodels are used to provide simpler prediction means than the complex simulation models they approximate. Accuracy of a metamodel is one fundamental criterion that is used as the basis for accepting or rejecting a metamodel. Average-based metrics such as root-mean-square error RMSE and R-square are often used. Like all other average-based statistics, these measures are sensitive to sample sizes unless the number of test points in these samples is adequate. We introduce in this paper a new metric that can be used to measure metamodels fit quality, called metamodel acceptability score MAS. The proposed metric gives readily interpretable meaning to metamodels acceptability. Furthermore, initial studies show that MAS is less sensitive to test sample sizes compared to average-based validation measures.

#!Automatic creation of B-rep models of engineering objects from freehand sketches would benefit designers. A subgoal is to take a single line drawing (with hidden lines removed), and from it deduce an initial 3D geometric realisation of the visible part of the object. Junction and line labels, and provisional depth coordinates, are important components of this frontal geometry. Most methods for producing frontal geometry use line labelling, but this takes little or no account of geometry. As a result, the line labels produced can be unreliable.Previously, we proposed an approach which inflates a drawing to produce provisional depth coordinates, and uses these to make deductions about line labels. Even a na&iuml;ve implementation can outperform previous line labelling methods in certain cases. In this paper, we further enhance this approach. We extend the algorithm to non-isometric-projection drawings, consider improved ways of realising some of the concepts, and also consider how to combine this approach with other labelling techniques to gain the benefits of each.We test our approach using to be drawings of what we consider representative samples of engineering objects; these exemplify difficulties not considered in many previous papers on line labelling. Our results, based on this test set, show that the enhancements result in significant benefits.

#!The most recent advances in external bone remodeling are shown using strain energy density (SED) and damage mechanics variables as stimulus functions. The Boundary Element Method (BEM) is used to obtain the tractions and displacements in each iteration.In this paper it is assumed that the level of damage and the strain energy near the periosteum and endosteum control the external bone remodeling response in the cortical of long bones. The boundary is modified as a function of time and the numerical analysis is solved through the method before mentioned for each variation of the boundary coordinates, then the geometry is evaluated and adapted. Smoothing techniques are used ([β-spline surfaces) to prevent sudden variations in the boundary that may hinder a solution convergence. To validate this model a numerical example is shown with previously validated experimental data from other authors.

#!We present a novel approach for interactively synthesizing motions for characters navigating in complex environments. We focus on the runtime efficiency for motion generation, thereby enabling the interactive animation of a large number of characters simultaneously. The key idea is to precompute search trees of motion clips that can be applied to arbitrary environments. Given a navigation goal relative to a current body position, the best available solution paths and motion sequences can be efficiently extracted during runtime through a series of table lookups. For distant start and goal positions, we first use a fast coarse-level planner to generate a rough path of intermediate sub-goals to guide each iteration of the runtime lookup phase.We demonstrate the efficiency of our technique across a range of examples in an interactive application with multiple autonomous characters navigating in dynamic environments. Each character responds in real-time to arbitrary user changes to the environment obstacles or navigation goals. The runtime phase is more than two orders of magnitude faster than existing planning methods or traditional motion synthesis techniques. Our technique is not only useful for autonomous motion generation in games, virtual reality, and interactive simulations, but also for animating massive crowds of characters offline for special effects in movies.

#!Given a sequence of n real numbers and an integer k, 1 ≤ k ≤ 1/2n(n - 1), the k maximum-sum segments problem is to locate the k segments whose sums are the k largest among all possible segment sums. Recently, Bengtsson and Chen gave an O(min{k + n log2 n, n√k})-time algorithm for this problem. Bae and Takaoka later proposed a more efficient algorithm for small k. In this paper, we propose an O(n + k log(min{n, k}))-time algorithm for the same problem, which is superior to both of them when k is o(n log n). We also give the first optimal algorithm for delivering the k maximum-sum segments in non-decreasing order if k ≤ n. Then we develop an O(n2d-1 + k log min{n, k})-time algorithm for the d-dimensional version of the problem, where d > 1 and each dimension, without loss of generality, is of the same size n. This improves the best previously known O(n2d-1C)-time algorithm, also by Bengtsson and Chen, where C = min{k + n log2 n, n√k}. It should be pointed out that, given a two-dimensional array of size m × n, our algorithm for finding the k maximum-sum subarrays is the first one achieving cubic time provided that k is O(m2n/log n).

Based on this postulate, the human visual system at low-level has been modeled from two approaches that give rise to two new tools. On one hand, it leads to the construction of a new image sharpening kernel, and on the other, to the explanation of more complex brightness-contrast illusions and the possible development of a new algorithm for robust visual capturing and display systems.

#!Use different real positive numbers p"i to represent all kinds of pattern categories, after mapping the inputted patterns into a special feature space by a non-linear mapping, a linear relation between the mapped patterns and numbers p"i is assumed, whose bias and coefficients are undetermined, and the hyper-plane corresponding to zero output of the linear relation is looked as the base hyper-plane. To determine the pending parameters, an objective function is founded aiming to minimize the difference between the outputs of the patterns belonging to a same type and the corresponding p"i, and to maximize the distance between any two different hyper-planes corresponding to different pattern types. The objective function is same to that of support vector regression in form, so the coefficients and bias of the linear relation are calculated by some known methods such as SVM^l^i^g^h^t approach. Simultaneously, three methods are also given to determine p"i, the best one is to determine them in training process, which has relatively high accuracy. Experiment results of the IRIS data set show that, the accuracy of this method is better than those of many SVM-based multi-class classifiers, and close to that of DAGSVM (decision-directed acyclic graph SVM), emphatically, the recognition speed is the highest.

#!The growth of different network architectures to connect wireless sensors for monitoring physical environments has become an important application area. Chief issues related to such systems include: (a) the permanence of environment monitoring, (b) the mobility management of sensors, (c) the adhoc communication method, and (d) the security of responsive messages. This paper presents an ad-hoc architecture and communication and mobility schemes to offer an efficient monitoring system in an environment where targets have unpredicted motion. Moreover, it introduces a security solution. The paper concludes by presenting the simulation results in order to validate the effectiveness of the proposed schemes.

#!The realistic simulation modeling becomes very essential and effective for designing and managing of manufacturing systems, which needs to be addressed manufacturing dynamics. This research includes manufacturing uncertainties in the form of simulation intelligence to improve the system's performance in the high-mix low-volume manufacturing systems. It shows how simulation modeling can be used to evaluate alternative designs in a dynamic uncertain manufacturing environment. Fuzzy rule based machine, labor and logistics uncertainties are addressed in this study. A combination of product mix and production volume is analyzed using intelligent simulation model for an optimal designing of the production system to meet future customer demands. Intelligent knowledge system shows significant close to real-life scenario. The proposed intelligent simulation modeling is validated with real life application.

#!This IBM Redbook provides an introduction to the IBM SOA Foundation, and includes a detailed implementation example for the Service Creation scenario. Part 1. "Getting started with IBM SOA Foundation,” includes an introduction to SOA from a business and architecture perspective. We describe the key elements of the IBM SOA Foundation, including the SOA life cycle, logical architecture, and SOA scenarios. Next we describe the Service Creation scenario in more detail since this is the focus of redbook example. We describe best practices and guidelines for SOA. In addition, we include a process for applying the SOA scenarios and patterns. Part 2 "Service Creation scenario example,” provides an end-to-end working example representative of the Service Creation scenario. We start by modeling the business requirements of a fictitious car rental company that has an existing J2EE based application. We demonstrate how to identify services using SOMA, and use a process for applying the SOA scenarios and reusable patterns to accelerate the creation of a solution architecture. The remaining chapters provide the implementation details to assemble using Rational Application Developer V6.0.1, deploy using WebSphere Application Server Network Deployment V6.0.2, and manage the solution using Tivoli Composite Application Manager for SOA V6.0.

#!Member-maintained communities ask their users to perform tasks the community needs. From Slashdot, to IMDb, to Wikipedia, groups with diverse interests create community-maintained artifacts of lasting value (CALV) that support the group's main purpose and provide value to others. Said communities don't help members find work to do, or do so without regard to individual preferences, such as Slashdot assigning meta-moderation randomly. Yet social science theory suggests that reducing the cost and increasing the personal value of contribution would motivate members to participate more.We present SuggestBot, software that performs intelligent task routing (matching people with tasks) in Wikipedia. SuggestBot uses broadly applicable strategies of text analysis, collaborative filtering, and hyperlink following to recommend tasks. SuggestBot's intelligent task routing increases the number of edits by roughly four times compared to suggesting random articles. Our contributions are: 1) demonstrating the value of intelligent task routing in a real deployment; 2) showing how to do intelligent task routing; and 3) sharing our experience of deploying a tool in Wikipedia, which offered both challenges and opportunities for research.

#!If you've wondered how the InDesign pros get twice the work done in half the time, here's the answer: They know every inside tip, every hidden keyboard shortcut, and every little trick that gives them the edge. They know the fastest, smartest, and most efficient way to do just about everything. In short, they know all the "tricks of the trade." And now, you can too.This book is packed cover-to-cover, wall-to-wall with nothing but those cool little inside tips that can make you faster, better, and have more fun using Adobe InDesign CS2. There are no detailed descriptions on working with hyphenation dictionaries, or long boring discussions on color workflow, it's just tips--short, sweet, and to the point.So why just tips? When we (you, me, etc.) look at books, if we see the word "Tip" we're all immediately drawn to it. That's because we know we're about to learn something really cool. Maybe it's an undocumented keyboard shortcut, a hidden inside secret, or just a faster, better way to do something we do every day. The only problem with the tips in these books is there's never enough of 'em. That is, until now.We wanted to create a book that is nothing but these tips, hundreds of tips, but with the added bonus that each tip would have a full color graphic along with it, showing you exactly how it's done. Most importantly, to get in this book they've got to be "Killer Tips." The kind of tip that makes you smile, nod, and then call all your friends and "tune them up" with your new status as InDesign guru.This book is your ticket to working faster and smarter in Adobe InDesign CS2 than you ever thought you could, and best of all, you'll have a blast doing it.

#!Many factors currently influence the NASA Kennedy Space Center (KSC) workforce, including the drive for return to flight, a stated Shuttle Program end date of 2010, and the Vision for Space Exploration which calls for the development of a new launch vehicle. Additionally, external factors such as cost of living in Central Florida, availability of skilled technical hires, and unemployment rate affect the overall workforce climate. Managing human capital in a manner consistent with safety and mission success, and to strategically position the center to execute its future mission, it is necessary to understand how these different influencing factors work together to produce an overall workforce climate. We have been using System Dynamics models to capture some of these factors. These models are also the starting point of agent-based models which can capture particular features not possible with the original system dynamics models. This paper introduces our simulation modeling efforts.

#!Motion capture data is now widely available to create realistic character animation. However, it is difficult to reuse without any additional information. For this reason, annotating motion data with kinematic constraints is a clever step to ease further operations such as blending or motion editing. Unfortunately, prior automatic methods prove to be unreliable for noisy data and/or lack genericity. In this paper, we present a method for detecting kinematic constraints for motion data. It detects when an object (or an end-effector) is stationary in space or is rotating around an axis or a point. Our method is fast, generic and may be used on any kind of objects in the scene. Furthermore, it is robust to highly noisy data as we detect and reject aberrant data by using a least median of squares (LMedS) method. We demonstrate the accuracy of our method in various motion editing contexts.

#!Valid models of the WWW are important for creating WWW-like representations, upon which new algorithms and applications for searching, indexing, compression etc. can be tested, but also for predicting the evolution of the web and the emergence of important new phenomena. In this study we introduce a validation process for web-graph models and use it to analyze the behavior of the Exponential Growth Copying Model, which has been explicitly designed to model the WWW. We study the effect of individual parameters on its effectiveness, suggest appropriate parameter values for the creation of web-like graphs and indicate inherent deficiencies of the model.

#!WDM optical networks provide unprecedented high speed and reliability for message transfer among the nodes. All-to-all routing is a fundamental routing problem in such networks and has been well studied on single hop WDM networks. However, the number of wavelengths to realize all-to-all routing on the single hop model typically is very large. One way to reduce the number of wavelengths is to use k-hop routing, in which each routing path consists of k segments and each segment is assigned a different wavelength, where k usually is a small constant. Because of the complexity of design and analysis for such a routing problem, only few papers discussed and proposed all-to-all routing by k ≥ 2 hops. However, the proposed algorithms are usually exceeding complicated even for ring topologies. Often, an ad hoc approach is employed to deal with each individual topology.In this paper we propose a generic method for all-to-all routing in multi-hop WDM networks, which aims to minimize the number of wavelengths. We illustrate the approach for several optical networks of commonly used topology, including lines, rings, tori, meshes, and complete binary trees. For each case an upper bound on the number of wavelengths is obtained. The results show that this approach produces clear routing paths, requires less wavelengths, and can easily incorporate load balancing. For simple topologies such as lines and rings, this approach easily produces the same bounds on the number of wavelengths that were hard-obtained previously. Moreover, this general approach provides a unified routing algorithm for any d-dimensional torus, which seems impossible to obtain by the previous approach.

#!This paper presents a new and powerful heterogeneous solid modeling paradigm for representing, modeling, and rendering of multi-dimensional, physical attributes across any volumetric objects. The modeled solid can be of complicated geometry and arbitrary topology. It is formulated using a trivariate simplex spline defined over a tetrahedral decomposition of any 3D domain. Heterogeneous material attributes associated with solid geometry can be modeled and edited by manipulating the control vectors and/or associated knots of trivariate simplex splines easily. The multiresolution capability is achieved by interactively subdividing any regions of interest and allocating more knots and control vectors accordingly. We also develop a feature-sensitive fitting algorithm that can reconstruct a more compact, continuous trivariate simplex spline from structured or unstructured volumetric grids. This multiresolution representation results from the adaptive and progressive tetrahedralization of the 3D domain. In addition, based on the simplex spline theory, we derive several theoretical formula and propose a fast direct rendering algorithm for interactive data analysis and visualization of the simplex spline volumes. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed paradigm augments the current modeling and visualization techniques with the new and unique advantages.

#!To make the best use of the resources in a shared grid environment, an application scheduler must make a prediction of available performance on each resource. In this paper, we examine the problem of predicting available CPU performance in time-shared grid system. We present and evaluate a new and innovative method to predict the one-step-ahead CPU load in a grid. Our prediction strategy forecasts the future CPU load based on the variety tendency in several past steps and in previous similar patterns, and uses a polynomial fitting method. Our experimental results on large load traces collected from four different kinds of machines demonstrate that this new prediction strategy achieves average prediction errors which are between 22% and 86% less than those incurred by four previous methods.

#!This paper presents simple and deterministic algorithms for partial point set pattern matching in 2D. Given a set P of n points, called sample set, and a query set Q of k points (n>=k), the problem is to find a matching of Q with a subset of P under rigid motion. The match may be of two types: exact and approximate. If an exact matching exists, then each point in Q coincides with the corresponding point in P under some translation and/or rotation. For an approximate match, some translation and/or rotation may be allowed such that each point in Q lies in a predefined @e-neighborhood region around some point in P. The proposed algorithm for the exact matching needs O(n^2) space and O(n^2logn) preprocessing time. The existence of a match for a given query set Q can be checked in O(k@alogn) time in the worst-case, where @a is the maximum number of equidistant pairs of point in P. For a set of n points, @a may be O(n^4^/^3) in the worst-case. Some applications of the partial point set pattern matching are then illustrated. Experimental results on random point sets and some fingerprint databases show that, in practice, the computation time is much smaller than the worst-case requirement. The algorithm is then extended for checking the exact match of a set of k line segments in the query set with a k-subset of n line segments in the sample set under rigid motion in O(knlogn) time. Next, a simple version of the approximate matching problem is studied where one point of Q exactly matches with a point of P, and each of the other points of Q lie in the @e-neighborhood of some point of P. The worst-case time and space complexities of the proposed algorithm are O(n^2k^2logn) and O(n), respectively. The proposed algorithms will find many applications to fingerprint matching, image registration, and object recognition.

#!In this paper, we describe the compiler developed to target the Molen reconfigurable processor and programming paradigm. The compiler automatically generates optimized binary code for C applications, based on pragma annotation of the code executed on the reconfigurable hardware. For the IBM PowerPC 405 processor included in the Virtex II Pro platform FPGA, we implemented code generation, register, and stack frame allocation following the PowerPC EABI (embedded application binary interface). The PowerPC backend has been extended to generate the appropriate instructions for the reconfigurable hardware and data transfer, taking into account the information of the specific hardware implementations and system. Starting with an annotated C application, a complete design flow has been integrated to generate the executable bitstream for the reconfigurable processor. The flexible design of the proposed infrastructure allows to consider the special features of the reconfigurable architectures. In order to hide the reconfiguration latencies, we implemented an instruction-scheduling algorithm for the dynamic hardware configuration instructions. The algorithm schedules, in advance, the hardware configuration instructions, taking into account the conflicts for the reconfigurable hardware resources (FPGA area) between the hardware operations. To verify the Molen compiler, we used the multimedia video frame M-JPEG encoder of which the extended discrete cosine transform (DCT&ast;) function was mapped on the FPGA. We obtained an overall speedup of 2.5 (about 84&percnt; efficiency over the maximal theoretical speedup of 2.96). The performance efficiency is achieved using automatically generated nonoptimized DCT&ast; hardware implementation. The instruction-scheduling algorithm has been tested for DCT, quantization, and VLC operations. Based on simulation results, we determine that, while a simple scheduling produces a significant performance decrease, our proposed scheduling contributes for up to 16x M-JPEG encoder speedup.

#!Many military planning problems are difficult to solve using pure mathematical programming techniques. One such problem is scheduling unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in military operations subject to dynamic movement and control constraints. This problem is instead formulated as a dynamic programming problem whose approximate solution is obtained via the Assignment Scheduling Capability for UAVs (ASC-U) model using concepts from both simulation and optimization. Optimization is very effective at identifying the best decision for static problems, but is weaker in identifying the best decision in dynamic systems. Simulation is very effective in modeling and capturing dynamic effects, but is weak in optimizing from alternatives. ASC-U exploits the relative strengths of both methodologies by periodically re-optimizing UAV assignments and then having the simulation transition the states according to state dynamics. ASC-U thus exploits the strengths of simulation and optimization to construct good, timely solutions that neither optimization nor simulation could achieve alone.

#*Detection of nuclear material at border crossings using motion correlation

#t2006
#cProceedings of the 38th conference on Winter simulation
#index1180
#!This paper considers the problem that arises when a vehicle carrying nuclear material is detected approaching a border crossing. As quickly as possible, and with automation we wish to identify which vehicle among all those in the area is likely to be carrying the source. We show that if the border crossing area has technology for tracking the position of vehicles, we can correlate observed movements with observed changes in levels of detected radiation---for as the vehicle carrying the material gets closer to the detector, the stronger will be the detected radiation. We use a simulation model that captures the stop-and-go dynamics of a border crossing area to evaluate our ideas, and find a highly successful technique that tracks which vehicles move just when detected radiation changes, coupled with fitting radiation intensity/distance observations to an inverse-square law. This method almost always isolates the sought vehicle just as soon as the minimum number of data observations is obtained.

#!Many databases contain uncertain and imprecise references to real-world entities. The absence of identifiers for the underlying entities often results in a database which contains multiple references to the same entity. This can lead not only to data redundancy, but also inaccuracies in query processing and knowledge extraction. These problems can be alleviated through the use of entity resolution. Entity resolution involves discovering the underlying entities and mapping each database reference to these entities. Traditionally, entities are resolved using pairwise similarity over the attributes of references. However, there is often additional relational information in the data. Specifically, references to different entities may cooccur. In these cases, collective entity resolution, in which entities for cooccurring references are determined jointly rather than independently, can improve entity resolution accuracy. We propose a novel relational clustering algorithm that uses both attribute and relational information for determining the underlying domain entities, and we give an efficient implementation. We investigate the impact that different relational similarity measures have on entity resolution quality. We evaluate our collective entity resolution algorithm on multiple real-world databases. We show that it improves entity resolution performance over both attribute-based baselines and over algorithms that consider relational information but do not resolve entities collectively. In addition, we perform detailed experiments on synthetically generated data to identify data characteristics that favor collective relational resolution over purely attribute-based algorithms.

#!In fingerprint verification systems, there are usually multiple (from two to four) enrolled impressions for a same finger. The performance of the systems can be improved by combining these impressions through feature fusion or decision fusion strategy. In this paper, different schemes to combine multiple enrolled impressions are comparatively studied. Experimental results show that a larger improvement can be obtained by using decision fusion scheme than feature fusion. In all decision fusion rules, sum rule outperforms voting rule a little whether using similarity or Neyman-Pearson rule. Based on the observation that the performance of these two strategies can complement each other, we also propose a novel fusion scheme to further combine feature fusion and decision fusion, which can produce an even better result.

#!This paper presents a connection handoff interface between the operating system and the network interface. Using this interface, the operating system can offload a subset of TCP connections in the system to the network interface, while the remaining connections are processed on the host CPU. Offloading can reduce computation and memory bandwidth requirements for packet processing on the host CPU. However, full TCP offloading may degrade system performance because finite processing and memory resources on the network interface limit the amount of packet processing and the number of connections. Using handoff, the operating system controls the number of offloaded connections in order to fully utilize the network interface without overloading it. Handoff is transparent to the application, and the operating system may choose to offload connections to the network interface or reclaim them from the interface at any time. A prototype system based on the modified FreeBSD operating system shows that handoff reduces the number of instructions and cache misses on the host CPU. As a result, the number of CPU cycles spent processing each packet decreases by 16--84%. Simulation results show handoff can improve web server throughput (SEPCweb99) by 15%, despite short-lived connections.

The differences between these groups translate into specific network requirements. Within some organizations, these requirements are so dissimilar that the different groups need to be treated as totally separate customers by the enterprise's IT department. As the number of groups increases, keeping them separate and secure is a challenge to IT departments, particularly with the advent of wireless networks, the requirement for enterprise-wide user mobility, and the need for cross group collaboration with resource sharing on a per project basis. Network Virtualization provides design guidance for virtualized enterprise networks and arms network architects with the background necessary to make sound technological choices in the face of different business requirements. As a means of introduction, Network Virtualization lays out the fundamentals of enterprise network design. The book builds upon these fundamental principles to introduce the different virtualization methods as the logical evolution of the enterprise network architecture. Detailed descriptions of the technology, design principles, network configurations, and real-world case studies are provided throughout the book, helping readers develop a pragmatic understanding of virtualized enterprise network architectures. Specific examples are included that tailor deployment advice to the small, medium, and large enterprise environment.

#!Fusion of sensor and communication data currently can only be performed at a late processing stage after sensor and textual information are formulated as logical statements at appropriately high level of abstraction. Contrary to this it seems, the human mind integrates sensor and language signals seamlessly, before signals are understood, at pre-conceptual level. Learning of conceptual contents of the surrounding world depends on language and vice versa. The paper describes a mathematical technique for such integration. It combines fuzzy dynamic logic with dual cognitive-language models. The paper briefly discusses relationships between the proposed mathematical technique, working of the mind and applications to understanding-based search engines.

#!Based on the recently published point symmetry distance (PSD) measure, this paper presents a novel PSD measure, namely symmetry similarity level (SSL) operator for K-means algorithm. Our proposed modified point symmetry-based K-means (MPSK) algorithm is more robust than the previous PSK algorithm by Su and Chou. Not only the proposed MPSK algorithm is suitable for the symmetrical intra-clusters as the PSK algorithm does, the proposed MPSK algorithm is also suitable for the symmetrical inter-clusters. In addition, two speedup strategies are presented to reduce the time required in the proposed MPSK algorithm. Experimental results demonstrate the significant execution-time improvement and the extension to the symmetrical inter-clusters of the proposed MPSK algorithm when compared to the previous PSK algorithm.

#!Computer simulation models will ideally be developed within an environment where all the necessary input data is readily available and all the relevant stakeholders are supportive and co-operative. In practice, many models are developed for the purpose of evaluating organisational or process change. As a result, system performance data may often be limited or potentially biased by key parties associated with the results of the simulation model. Ensuring valid input data is therefore a key aspect of model validation and an important component in a successful simulation study. This paper addresses some examples of data collection problems that have been encountered by the author and presents a number of lessons identified.

#!A remote user authentication scheme is a two-party protocol whereby an authentication server in a distributed system confirms the identity of a remote individual logging on to the server over an untrusted, open network. Recently, Lee et al. have proposed an efficient nonce-based scheme for remote user authentication using smart cards. This work reviews Lee et al.'s authentication scheme and provides a security analysis on the scheme. Our analysis shows that Lee et al.'s scheme does not achieve its basic aim of authenticating remote users and furthermore has a very hazardous method for changing passwords. In addition, we recommend some changes to the scheme so that it can attain at least its main security goal.

#!Intel's Fab-18 is based in Israel, and has transitioned from producing 0.18-micron logic devices to producing 90nM flash products. During this transition period, the factory has de-ramped in volume of logic while ramping-up flash. AutoSched AP software was utilized for the development of a transient simulation model of the Fab's behavior during this period. It is the first attempt, at Intel, to utilize a full factory simulation in order to analyze and support decisions that pertain to a transient period of parallel de-ramp and ramp-up of technologies. Unlike typical simulation models for the analysis of factory performance and behavior in steady-state, the transient model poses several modeling challenges and requires major adjustments in dealing with these challenges. In this paper, we discuss those aspects. The benefits and contribution of such a model to decision making and the improvement of factory performance are also presented.

#!In many real-world optimization problems, the objective function may come from a simulation evaluation so that it is (a) subject to various levels of noise, (b) not differentiable, and (c) computationally hard to evaluate. In this paper, we modify Powell's UOBYQA algorithm to handle those real-world simulation problems. Our modifications apply Bayesian techniques to guide appropriate sampling strategies to estimate the objective function. We aim to make the underlying UOBYQA algorithm proceed efficiently while simultaneously controlling the amount of computational effort.

#!Bio-ontologies are hierarchical vocabularies, which are used to annotate other data sources such as sequence and structure databases. With the wide use of ontologies their integration, design, and evolution becomes an important problem. We show how textmining on relevant text corpora can be used to identify matching ontology terms of two separate ontologies and to propose new ontology terms for a given term. We evaluate these approaches on the GeneOntology.

The algorithm receives as input two first-order terms, and it returns a most general unifier of these terms if they are unifiable, failure otherwise. The verified implementation stores terms as directed acyclic graphs by means of a pointer structure. Its time complexity is $O(n^2)$ and its space complexity $O(n)$ , and it can be executed in ACL2 at a speed comparable to a similar C implementation. We report the main issues encountered to achieve this formally verified implementation.

#!Diffusion processes, and their discrete time counterparts, random walk models, have demonstrated an ability to account for a wide range of findings from behavioural decision making for which the purely algebraic and deterministic models often used in economics and psychology cannot account. Recent studies that record neural activations in non-human primates during perceptual decision making tasks have revealed that neural firing rates closely mimic the accumulation of preference theorized by behaviourally-derived diffusion models of decision making.This article bridges the expanse between the neurophysiological and behavioural decision making literatures specifically, decision field theory [Busemeyer, J. R. & Townsend, J. T. (1993). Decision field theory: A dynamic-cognitive approach to decision making in an uncertain environment. Psychological Review, 100, 432-459], a dynamic and stochastic random walk theory of decision making, is presented as a model positioned between lower-level neural activation patterns and more complex notions of decision making found in psychology and economics. Potential neural correlates of this model are proposed, and relevant competing models are also addressed.

Using an exactly solvable 1-dimensional model, we derive a set of closed formulas that describe the quality of MANETs concerning connectivity, stability, and coverage. These results allow us to predict the minimum number of network nodes for a certain quality level (the "critical mass") without the need for numerical simulations.

#!Performance is an important attribute of a software system. To develop a software system of acceptable performance, the team needs to specify precise performance requirements, design appropriate test cases, and use suitable techniques to analyze the performance characteristics. However, the lack of a structured framework for performance engineering may impair the effectiveness of the techniques. We propose the Performance Refinement and Evolution Model (PREM) as a performance management framework. Based on the specification of quantitative measurement and workloads, PREM classifies performance requirements specification, analysis activities, and testing into four levels. In this paper, we provide an overview of this model.

#!In the dynamic environment of semiconductor manufacturing operations, a bottleneck could be created at the bake furnaces of the deposition loop as capacity expands. Upgrading of the bake furnaces by adding a lot-per-batch in the boat or purchasing a new furnace are two possible solutions to this problem. A simulation model was constructed to assist the decision making, with the behavior of the wet benches (upstream tools) and cluster tools (downstream tools) being modeled in detail. We concluded that a limited number of furnaces upgrade is sufficient to sustain the capacity expansion. But the bottleneck was shifted to an upstream tool, which required the backup tool to be activated to manage the queue. A loading policy that constrains batches to queue at maximum time before loading into the furnaces has to be implemented to balance the efficiency at the furnaces and their downstream tools, without compromising on the cycle time.

#!Determining optimal subspace projections that can maintain task-relevant information in the data is an important problem in machine learning and pattern recognition. In this paper, we propose a nonparametric nonlinear subspace projection technique that maintains class separability maximally under the Shannon mutual information (MI) criterion. Employing kernel density estimates for nonparametric estimation of MI makes possible an interesting marriage of kernel density estimation-based information theoretic methods and kernel machines, which have the ability to determine nonparametric nonlinear solutions for difficult problems in machine learning. Significant computational savings are achieved by translating the definition of the desired projection into the kernel-induced feature space, which leads to obtain analytical solution.

#!This paper describes an approach based on evolutionary algorithms, HIDER (HIerarchical DEcision Rules), for learning rules in continuous and discrete domains. The algorithm produces a hierarchical set of rules, that is, the rules are sequentially obtained and must be therefore tried in order until one is found whose conditions are satisfied. Due to the computational cost of the evolutionary algorithms, we have developed a preprocesing method to reduce the number of examples from the database. This method, named EOP (Editing by Ordered Projections), has some interesting characteristics, especially from the point of view of the application of axis&dash;parallel classifiers. We have tested our system on real data from the UCI Repository, and the results of a 10&dash;fold cross&dash;validation are compared to C4.5's and C4.5Rules'. The experiments showed that HIDER works well in practice.

#!This paper proposes a novel edge detection method for both gray level images and color images. The 3x3 mask in the image is considered and two pixel sets S"0 and S"1 in the mask are used to define an objective function. The values of the objective function corresponding to four directions determine the edge intensity and edge direction of each pixel in the mask. After all pixels in the image have been processed, the edge map and direction map are generated. Then we apply the non-maxima suppression method to the edge map and the direction map to extract the edge points. The proposed method can detect the edge successfully, while double edges, thick edges, and speckles can be avoided.

#!The objective of this paper is to present the development of a simulation model involving materials handling in a large steel company from Arcelor Group. The project had a return of more than 2 million USD and points to a kind of application that seems to be a typical case where static analysis may cause great errors comparing to a dynamic one (because the results were also observed in another Brazilian steel company). The project focused in the processes involving pig iron transportation between the blast furnaces and its discharge in the steelmaking plant. It allowed the evaluation of several operational parameters such as for the 7.5 Mt/year production rhythm, a great increase from the actual production of 5 Mt/year. "Bottlenecks" in the flow were identified through the results and the scenarios gave the support to the decision of increasing the number of torpedo-cars and locomotives in the system.

#index1355
#!Pervasive computing environments introduce new requirements in expressiveness and flexibility of access control policies which are almost addressable leveraging contextual information. Although context-awareness augments the expressiveness of policies, it increases the probability of arising conflicts. Generally, context-aware authorizations are defined using some contextual constraints on the involved entities in an access request. Accordingly, principles like "more specific overrides", which are employed to resolve possible conflicts, are required to consider the contextual constraints. In this paper, we formalize the use of context constraints in a typical context-aware multi-authority policy model; each authority is capable of defining an expressive conflict resolution policy leveraging context-based precedence establishment principles. Based on the policy model, we propose a comprehensive graph-based approach to resolve conflicts. The strength of the approach is that conflict detection which requires context-based inference is almost done statically and resolution is left for run-time.

#!Providing data availability in a high performance computing environment is very important, especially in this data-intensive world. Most clusters either equip with RAID (Redundant Array of Independent Disks) devices or use redundant nodes to protect data from loss. However, neither of these can really solve the reliability problem incurred in a striped file system. Striping provides an efficient way to increase I/O throughput both in the distributed and parallel paradigms. But it also reduces the overall reliability of a disk system by N fold, where N is the number of independent disks in the system. Parallel Virtual File System (PVFS) is an open source parallel file system which has been widely used in the Linux environment. Its striping structure is good for performance but provides no fault tolerance. We implement Reliable Parallel File System (RPFS) based on PVFS but with reliability support. Our quantitative analysis shows that MTTF (Mean Time To Failure) of our RPFS is better than that of PVFS. Besides, we propose a parity cache table (PCT) to alleviate the penalty of parity updating. The evaluation of our RPFS shows that its read performance is almost the same as that of PVFS (2% to 13% degradation). As to the write performance, 28% to 45% improvement can be achieved depending on the behavior of the operations.

#!Summary: Sungear is a software system that supports a rapid, visually interactive and biologist-driven comparison of large datasets. The datasets can come from microarray experiments (e.g. genes induced in each experiment), from comparative genomics (e.g. genes present in each genome) or even from non-biological applications (e.g. demographics or baseball statistics). Sungear represents multiple datasets as vertices in a polygon. Each possible intersection among the sets is represented as a circle inside the polygon. The position of the circle is determined by the position of the vertices represented in the intersection and the area of the circle is determined by the number of elements in the intersection. Sungear shows which Gene Ontology terms are over-represented in a subset of circles or anchors. The intuitive Sungear interface has enabled biologists to determine quickly which dataset or groups of datasets play a role in a biological function of interest. Availability: A live online version of Sungear can be found at http://virtualplant-prod.bio.nyu.edu/cgi-bin/sungear/index.cgi Contact: shasha@cs.nyu.edu Supplementary information: Submitted---link TBD.

#!Recently, cars are equipped with a lot of sensors for safety driving. We have been trying to store the driving-scene video with such sensor data and to detect the change of scenery of streets. Detection results can be used for building historical database of town scenery, automatic landmark updating of maps, and so forth. In order to compare images to detect changes, image retrieval taken at nearly identical locations is required as the first step. Since Global Positioning System (GPS) data essentially contain some noises, we cannot rely only on GPS data for our image retrieval. Therefore, we have developed an image retrieval algorithm employing edge-histogram-based image features in conjunction with hierarchical search. By using edge histograms projected onto the vertical and horizontal axes, the retrieval has been made robust to image variation due to weather change, clouds, obstacles, and so on. In addition, matching cost has been made small by limiting the matching candidates employing the hierarchical search. Experimental results have demonstrated that the mean retrieval accuracy has been improved from 65% to 76% for the front-view images and from 34% to 53% for the side-view images.

#index1395
#!The solar wind makes the magnetosphere to expand and contract as indicated by the expansions and contractions of the auroral oval due to balancing of the dynamic pressure of the ambient space plasma at inner and outer magnetic lines. This self-similar magnetospheric behavior elucidates the controversial magnetic storm-substorm relationship and reveals the 3D-spiral structure of magnetic interaction. The found self-similarly evolving structure of one seen as fundamental interaction suggests dynamic fractal unifying interaction that builds a firework universe having 3D-spiral code. The unifying interaction is described with equation drawn in new fundamental dynamic fractal framework. The equation of unifying interaction converges to the inverse square laws and the principle of uncertainty at laboratory scales. The dynamic fractal fundamental framework is made of one 3D-spirally-faster-inward contracting and expanding, oscillating, basic matter. It simply accounts for observed constant speed of light and for the creation of bright and dark bands on a screen behind a tiny slit. The dynamic fractal framework is quantitatively confirmed with the orbital data for the Milky Way Galaxy, the Sun, the Earth, and the triple asteroid system 87 Sylvia. Many testable predictions are also made. The presented new fundamental dynamic fractal framework allows qualitative and quantitative modeling and simplification. &copy; 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

#!A class of implicit two-step integration methods is introduced having s stages which may be computed in parallel. Since all stage solutions are approximations with equal accuracy and stability properties these methods were attributed as 'peer' methods. Using a special result on Vandermonde matrices we identify one subclass of order s-1 which is zero stable for general stepsize sequences. A further analysis for singularly perturbed problems shows that no order reduction occurs and the accuracy is essentially determined by the regularity of the smooth component. These results are backed by several numerical examples even including one differential algebraic problem.

#!For a simplicial complex X and a field K, let h˜i(X) = dim H˜i (X; K).It is shown that if X, Y are complexes on the same vertex set, then for k ≥ 0 h˜k-1(X ∩ Y) ≤ Σσ ∈ Y Σi+j=k h˜i-1 (X[σ])ċ h˜j-1 (lk(Y, σ)).A simplicial complex X is d-Leray over K, if H˜i(Y; K) = 0 for all induced subcomplexes Y ⊂ X and i ≥ d. Let LK(X) denote the minimal d such that X is d-Leray over K. The above theorem implies that if X, Y are simplicial complexes on the same vertex set then LK(X ∩ Y) ≤ LK(X) + LK(Y).Reformulating this inequality in commutative algebra terms, we obtain the following result conjectured by Terai: If I, J are square-free monomial ideals in S = K[x1, ..., xn], then reg(I + J) ≤ reg(I) + reg(J) - 1, where reg (I) denotes the Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity of I.

#!The complexity of animating trees, shrubs and foliage is an impediment to the efficient and realistic depiction of natural environments. This paper presents an algorithm to extract, from a single video sequence, motion fields of real shrubs under the influence of wind, and to transfer this motion to the animation of complex, synthetic 3D plant models. The extracted motion is retargeted without requiring physical simulation. First, feature tracking is applied to the video footage, allowing the 2D position and velocity of automatically identified features to be clustered. A key contribution of the method is that the hierarchy obtained through statistical clustering can be used to synthesize a 2D hierarchical geometric structure of branches that terminates according to the cut-off threshold of a classification algorithm. This step extracts both the shape and the motion of a hierarchy of features groups that are identified as geometrical branches. The 2D hierarchy is then extended to three dimensions using the estimated spatial distribution of the features within each group. Another key contribution is that this 3D hierarchical structure can be efficiently used as a motion controller to animate any complex 3D model of similar but non-identical plants using a standard skinning algorithm. Thus, a single video source of a moving shrub becomes an input device for a large class of virtual shrubs. We illustrate the results on two examples of shrubs and one outdoor tree. Extensions to other outdoor plants are discussed.

#!Within the European &lsquo;Vehicle Model Based Diagnosis&rsquo; (VMBD) project, demonstrator vehicles with built&dash;in faults provided a serious challenge to model&dash;based diagnosis techniques and a real&dash;life test&dash;bed for their evaluation. One of the guiding applications within VMBD was model&dash;based on&dash;board diagnosis of faults in a turbo diesel engine system with a focus on potential origins of increased carbon emissions. This paper focuses on the application aspects. We discuss the requirements imposed, the way they were addressed by the chosen solutions, and the results obtained by the on&dash;board diagnosis prototype running on the demonstrator vehicle. The most important challenges of the demonstrator were to apply model&dash;based diagnosis systems to dynamic systems with feedback, to handle systems without a rigorous mathematical model (such as a combustion engine), and to try to provide the response times required for real&dash;time applications.

#!We propose a robust algorithm for estimating the projective reconstruction from image features using the RANSAC-based Triangulation method. In this method, we select input points randomly, separate the input points into inliers and outliers by computing their reprojection error, and correct the outliers so that they can become inliers. The reprojection error and correcting outliers are computed using the Triangulation method. After correcting the outliers, we can reliably recover projective motion and structure using the projective factorization method. Experimental results showed that errors can be reduced significantly compared to the previous research as a result of robustly estimated projective reconstruction.

#!Ontological analysis has been shown to be an effective first step in the construction of robust knowledge based systems. However, the modeling and simulation community has not taken advantage of the benefits of ontology management methods and tools. Moreover, the popularity of semantic technologies and the semantic web has provided several beneficial opportunities for the modeling and simulation communities of interest. This paper describes the role of ontologies in facilitating simulation modeling. It outlines the technical challenges in distributed simulation modeling and describes how ontology-based methods may be applied to address these challenges. The paper concludes by describing an ontology-based solution framework for simulation modeling and analysis and outlining the benefits of this solution approach.

#!Every company large and small wants to boost its sales, control its spending, and keep the auditors at the Internal Revenue Service happy. But, no company wants to waste time on more paperwork. These days, a growing number of companies are turning to QuickBooks accounting software not only to speed up their bookkeeping efforts, but manage their businesses more effectively. Organizations come in all shapes, sizes, and business models, so it's no surprise that accounting practices can be a convoluted road to travel. QuickBooks can handle many of the financial tasks companies face, but the price you pay is an overabundance of software features. To make the learning curve even more challenging, QuickBooks doesn't come with a manual. Fortunately, to help pave the road to accounting success, there's QuickBooks 2005: The Missing Manual, a comprehensive guide from O'Reilly that examines everything the QuickBooks Pro edition has to offer, from invoices and inventory to assets and accounts payable. With QuickBooks 2005: The Missing Manual, financial managers can quickly learn how to use the program's tools to implement and maintain critical accounting processes. By covering details in a friendly and light-hearted way, the book explains when and why a feature is useful, and then offers indispensable, relevant advice. Each page of this Missing Manual provides insightful tips and tricks to help readers become more efficient, sophisticated users no matter what the extent of their existing knowledge is. Whether you're interested in QuickBooks for its basic bookkeeping features or its more powerful, business planning tools, the only way to truly harness its power is to read the book that should have been in the box: QuickBooks 2005: The Missing Manual.

#cInteracting with Computers
#index1538
#!Recently, research in individual differences and in particular, learning and cognitive style, has been used as a basis to consider learner preferences in a web-based educational context. Modelling style in a web-based learning environment demands that developers build a specific framework describing how to design a variety of options for learners with different approaches to learning. In this paper two representative examples of educational systems, Flexi-OLM and INSPIRE, that provide learners a variety of options designed according to specific style categorisations, are presented. Experimental results from two empirical studies performed on the systems to investigate learners' learning and cognitive style, and preferences during interaction, are described. It was found that learners do have a preference regarding their interaction, but no obvious link between style and approaches offered, was detected. Derived from an examination of this experimental data, we suggest that while style information can be used to inform the design of learning environments that accommodate learners' individual differences, it would be wise to recommend interactions based on learners' behaviour. Learning environments should allow learners or learners' interaction behaviour to select or trigger the appropriate approach for the particular learner in the specific context. Alternative approaches towards these directions are also discussed.

#index1554
#!Although many defense techniques against scanning worms have been developed, they have difficulty in ingress filtering if the incoming scanning traffic has insufficient intensity, which is usually the case. To make matters worse, legitimate Internet services behaving like worms and dynamic network environments undermines the efficacy of the techniques. In this paper, we propose a simple and efficient defense algorithm against Internet scanning worms that has high detection rate and low false positive rate. Our defense algorithm observes the protocol behavior of TCP SYN retries and applies a relative entropy scheme, which is used for measuring the distance between two distributions, to process the collected information. It builds up the black-list to isolate detected hosts from the Internet, and adjusts related parameters adaptively according to the observed traffic. Moreover, it acquires the simplicity and effectiveness at the ingress point only by inspecting SYN retry on a unidirectional link, which makes the defense mechanism easily applicable to a network. Against real-life traces, we investigate the performance of our algorithm and compare it with that of SNORT. The results manifest clearly that our algorithm outperforms the rate-based detection technique in terms of detection rate, detection speed and false positive rate.

#!Packet loss models play an essential role in computer networks analysis. Performance evaluation studies often abstract the loss and delay characteristics of a path or network with a single end-to-end analytical model. This model should be able to represent the characteristics of the path and accurately reproduce the impact of delay and losses on the studied protocol while keeping complexity low.

#!This paper presents a Business-Oriented Model of Factors that affect the adoption of wireless High Speed Data Services (HSDS). We reviewed business IT acceptance literature and developed an explorative survey of a sample of twelve companies in Europe and USA. From this, a theoretical model was created and hypotheses were formulated. Data were then collected on a sample of 1545 companies in USA and Europe. Based on these results, we developed a model that combined the key ideas of both TAM and TTF and showed that both were necessary in predicting wireless High Speed Data Service adoption.

#!“This book clearly shows how today's industry pressures and business challenges mandate renewal of the contract between organizations and their IT assets and peopleï¾and it illustrates how a service-oriented approach to IT can help organizations go through the necessary transformation. The role of governance in bringing IT and business closer together is particularly well explained, and the book is worth reading for that alone.” ï¾Neil Ward-Dutton, Research Director, Macehiter Ward-Dutton “It's easy to pay lip service to the concept of business/IT alignment, but in The New Language of Business, Sandy Carter walks the walk. Few treatments of SOA ground this admittedly difficult topic in the world of business as thoroughly as Sandy has here. I'd recommend this book to any business reader who wants to leverage IT to make their business more agile and innovative, and to any technical reader who wishes to understand how to place SOA in the business context where it belongs.” ï¾Jason Bloomberg, Senior Analyst and Principal, ZapThink LLC “A very valuable read. In today's globally connected marketplace profitable growth requires business flexibility and continuous innovation, both of which are increasingly proving to be impossible without business modularity and the new table-stakes technology SOA.” ï¾Ron Williams, Professor, Kenan-Flagler Business School, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill “Sandy has provided a pragmatic and holistic perspective on Service Oriented Architectures. She adds credibility by sharing IBM's in-depth customer research as well as case studies to support the findings. The book is a strong source book for those wanting to get started with SOA.” ï¾Judith Hurwitz, President & CEO, Hurwitz & Associates, coauthor, Service Oriented Architectures for Dummies “Few people have thought as long or as hard about SOA as Sandy Carter. This book embodies her invaluable work and the work of many at IBM to research, define, deploy and make SOA happen. Useful not just from a SOA perspective, but also as a concise articulation of the contemporary concepts fundamental to understanding where business and IT are heading.” ï¾Carol Baroudi, coauthor Service Oriented Architecture For Dummies, Senior Analyst, Aberdeen Group “The New Language of Business: SOA & Web 2.0 is based on the collective feedback from industry leaders at organizations of all sizes, in more than 50 countries, who shared their views, experiences, and challenges of aligning technology with business goals.” ï¾From the foreword by Steve Mills, Senior Vice President and Group Executive,ï¾ IBM Software Group There is now a direct, provable link between an organization's flexibility and business performance. To optimize flexibility, companies must achieve unprecedented levels of integration and automation of key processes and infrastructure, both internally and externally. At the same time, they must learn to manage their processes far more dynamically and responsively. They must become flex-pon-sive*. Until recently, technology stood in the way of achieving these goals. Thanks to the emergence of service oriented architecture (SOA), Web 2.0, and open standards, technology now enables companies to achieve those goals. In The New Language of Business, one of IBM's top SOA strategist demonstrates how business leaders can use innovations in technology to drive dramatic process improvements and support accelerating change. Sandy Carter shows how to deconstruct your business into a “componentized” business model, then support that model with linked, repeatable IT services that can adapt quickly, easily, and economically. These techniques will help both IT professionals and business leaders reach new levels of operational excellence to deliver the market-focused innovations that matter most.

#!Runtime Patterns with Caching Proxy and Tivoli Access Manager User authentication and authorization Runtime node placement guidelines Security is such a fundamental enabler of e-busines that in the emerging business-to-consumer (B2C) and business-to-business (B2B) markets, effective security can make the difference betwen being successful and becoming an “also ran”. The promise of e-business and its ability to create new revenue streams is predicated on the ability of these new business processes to reach these new markets and customers. That promise can evaporate if security issues are not addressed up front. This IBM Redbook addresses the security issues of user authentication and authorization using the concept of Patterns. Patterns for e-business are a group of proven, reusable assets that can help speed the process of developing applications. In this redbook, we describe guidelines and options for the selection of Runtime patterns that include user authentication and authorization considerations in the design process. Specifically, we address software and node configuration scenarios within the demilitarized zone (DMZ) and give examples of implementation procedures.

#!Message-based communication offers the potential benefits of providing stronger specification and cleaner separation between components. Compared with shared-memory interactions, message passing has the potential disadvantages of more expensive data exchange (no direct sharing) and more complicated programming.In this paper we report on the language, verification, and run-time system features that make messages practical as the sole means of communication between processes in the Singularity operating system. We show that using advanced programming language and verification techniques, it is possible to provide and enforce strong system-wide invariants that enable efficient communication and low-overhead software-based process isolation. Furthermore, specifications on communication channels help in detecting programmer mistakes early---namely at compile-time---thereby reducing the difficulty of the message-based programming model.The paper describes our communication invariants, the language and verification features that support them, as well as implementation details of the infrastructure. A number of benchmarks show the competitiveness of this approach.

#!Desktop operating systems such as Windows and Linux base scheduling decisions on CPU consumption; processes that consume fewer CPU cycles are prioritized, assuming that interactive processes gain from this since they spend most of their time waiting for user input. However, this doesn't work for modern multimedia applications which require significant CPU resources. We therefore suggest a new metric to identify interactive processes by explicitly measuring interactions with the user, and we use it to design and implement a process scheduler. Measurements using a variety of applications indicate that this scheduler is very effective in distinguishing between competing interactive and noninteractive processes.

#!We consider involutory antimorphisms ϕ of a free monoid A* and their fixed points, called ϕ-palindromes or pseudopalindromes. A ϕ-palindrome reduces to a usual palindrome when ϕ is the reversal operator. For any word w ∈ A* the right (resp. left) ϕ-palindrome closure of w is the shortest ϕ-palindrome having w as a prefix (resp. suffix). We prove some results relating ϕ-palindrome closure operators with periodicity and conjugacy, and derive some interesting closure properties for the languages of finite Sturmian and episturmian words. In particular, a finite word w is Sturmian if and only if both its palindromic closures are so. Moreover, in such a case, both the palindromic closures of w share the same minimal period of w. A new characterization of finite Sturmian words follows, in terms of periodicity and special factors of their palindromic closures. Some weaker results can be extended to the episturmian case. By using the right ϕ-palindrome closure, we extend the construction of standard episturmian words via directive words. In this way one obtains a family of infinite words, called ϕ-standard words, which are morphic images of episturmian words, as well as a wider family of infinite words including the Thue-Morse word on two symbols.

#*A parametric associative memory emulation
#@S. H. Dalrymple
#t1975
#cACM SIGMICRO Newsletter
#index1606
#!An experimental associative memory facility has been created by microprogramming a conventional computer. The microprogramming was done by expansion of an IBM 1130 emulation that was microcoded on a Digital Scientific Corporation META 4 computer. The associative memory (AM), as seen by the 1130 applications programmer, is an integral part of the computer with 54 machine instructions provided for its control and use.The structural characteristics of the apparent associative memory are parametrically defined to the emulation via a special SETUP command. This command may occur repeatedly within a program to dynamically alter the AM's characteristics or, indeed, to provide several different AM's. The characteristics that may be specified include the cell width (W) in 16-bit word increments, the number of cells (N), the locations in core memory to be used by the AM and its associated registers, and the memory protect status of these memory locations. The parameters are maintained in a fast scratch-pad memory, whence they are employed to control the AM emulation.Three pseudoregisters are used by the associative memory: (1) a data register (DR), which can hold the contents of one cell (i. e., W bits in length); (2) a response register (RR) N bits in length; and (3) an availability register (AR), also N bits in length.The data register provides the primary interface between the AM and the 1130 program. The response register is employed to indicate which cells in the AM have responded to a given search command. The availability register is used to indicate which cells are empty (or available) and which are to be considered whenever a search command is executed. The AM can be addressed either conventionally or associatively.The commands provided to utilize the AM fall into five categories: (1) register commands to manipulate the DR, RR, and AR; (2) fetch and store commands to store and retrieve information; (3) search commands to compare a given argument against the AM; (4) field-to-field search commands that compare two fields within each cell; and (5) test and branch instructions. Field specifications for search commands are defined through the use of pointer and length information contained within the command.Communication with the AM is via the DR. Search arguments and data to be stored are placed there, as are data retrieved from the AM. Searches permitted include match, no match, less than, less than or equal to, greater than, greater than or equal to, next lower, next greater, minimum, and maximum.The commands themselves, viewed as 1130 operators, may occupy either one, two, or three machine words, depending upon the operation, and may contain an address, one or two pointer specifications, one or two length specifications, a reset flag, or an immediate value, as required. Indexing is permitted for those operations having an address. The code-cracking mechanism of the 1130 emulation is used but is augmented to handle the three-word instructions. Microsubprograms are then executed for each emulated instruction or class of instructions.The META 4 computer on which the AM system was implemented is a flexible, logical processor that is controlled by an easily modified, random-access, read-only memory (ROM). Up to 32 general-purpose registers may be employed, together with three data buses (two source and one destination), an arithmetic-logical unit, and a shifter unit. Control is exercised at the gate level via microcode commands, 32 bits in length, in the ROM. Core memory is treated essentially as a peripheral with access via a pair of registers, one for data and the other for address information. The usual complement of peripherals, card readers, printers, disks, etc., may be attached.The basic hardware configuration required for 1130 emulation on a META 4 consists of 8K main-core memory, 2K read-only memory, and 20 registers. This configuration was augmented for the AM emulation by the addition of 8K more core, 2K additional ROM, two additional registers, two scratch-pad memories of 64 words each, and a set of internal timers to provide timing information on application programs.Several applications have been programmed in both a conventional manner and by using the associative memory capability in order to obtain relative timing information. One such application, a personnel file information storage and retrieval system, has provided a speed advantage of as much as 10 to 1 when the AM is employed. Building on the AM capability, a set of macroinstructions was developed to provide an apparent associative processor. Several matrix manipulation routines were developed using this facility, and these routines also exhibited a significant speed advantage over their conventionally programmed counterparts.

Distributed database access and DB2's DDF have come a long way since. DDF is now a full-function transaction monitor, using a highly efficient database interoperability protocol (DRDA) equipped with thread pooling and connection management that allows it to support very large networks. In this IBM Redbook we describe how to set up your DDF environment, and how to deploy the DDF capabilities in different configurations, including how to develop applications that access distributed databases. We also describe a set of more advanced features, such as thread pooling, and high availability distributed configurations, in a DB2 data sharing environment. We also demonstrate the advantages of using HiperSockets with DB2 for z/OS and OS/390 and DB2 Connect for zLinux. As performance and problem analysis are very important in today's production environments with applications demanding subsecond response times and zero down time, the publication also discusses the traces available to you to do performance monitoring and problem determination. We hope that after reading this publication you will have a better view of a wide range of functions that DDF has to offer, and say "Wow, I had no idea that I could do all of this with DDF!"

#!Several strategies to retrieve depth information from a sequence of images have been described so far. In this paper a method that turns around the existing symbiosis between stereovision and motion is introduced; motion minimizes correspondence ambiguities, and stereovision enhances motion information. The central idea behind our approach is to transpose the spatially defined problem of disparity estimation into the spatial-temporal domain. Motion is analyzed in the original sequences by means of the so-called permanency effect and the disparities are calculated from the resulting two-dimensional motion charge maps. This is an important contribution to the traditional stereovision depth analysis, where disparity is got from the image luminescence. In our approach, disparity is studied from a motion-based persistency charge measure.

#!This paper proposes a hybrid genetic algorithm (a-hGA) with adaptive local search scheme. For designing the a-hGA, a local search technique is incorporated in the loop of genetic algorithm (GA), and whether or not the local search technique is used in the GA is automatically determined by the adaptive local search scheme. Two modes of adaptive local search schemes are developed in this paper. First mode is to use the conditional local search method that can measure the average fitness values obtained from the continuous two generations of the a-hGA, while second one is to apply the similarity coefficient method that can measure a similarity among the individuals of the population of the a-hGA. These two adaptive local search schemes are included in the a-hGA loop, respectively. Therefore, the a-hGA can be divided into two types: a- hGA1 and a-hGA2. To prove the efficiency of the a-hGA1 and a-hGA2, a canonical GA (cGA) and a hybrid GA (hGA) with local search technique and without any adaptive local search scheme are also presented. In numerical example, all the algorithms (cGA, hGA, a-hGA1 and a-hGA2) are tested and analyzed. Finally, the efficiency of the proposed a-hGA1 and a-hGA2 is proved by various measures of performance.

#!This paper presents a novel VR (Virtual Reality) trained BDI (belief, desire, intention) software agent used to construct crowd simulations for emergency response. The BDI framework allows modeling of human behavior with a high degree of fidelity. The proposed simulation has been developed using AnyLogic software to mimic crowd evacuation from an area under a terrorist bomb attack. The attributes that govern the BDI characteristics of the agent are studied by conducting human in the loop experiments in VR using the CAVE (Cave Automatic Virtual Environment). To enhance generality and interoperability of the proposed crowd simulation modeling scheme, input data models have been developed to define environment attributes. Experiments are also conducted to demonstrate the effect of various parameters on key performance indicators such as crowd evacuation rate and densities.

#!The effects of metaphors on learning have been proved by many studies. Learners naturally invoke metaphors when learning new concepts because metaphors stimulate them to generate models of the domain to be learned. However, little evidence has been seen of metaphors' effect on developing learners' mental models. Since metaphors function by providing familiar concepts that help learners to construct new knowledge, metaphors' effects may be more apparent to novice learners. This study explores the effects of metaphors on both novice and expert learners' performance and their mental-model development as documented by three different measurement methods. It also examines the relationship between subjects' performance and their mental models. The results indicate that metaphors may facilitate novices' construction of integrative knowledge but not simple knowledge. In addition, metaphors may possibly have lasting effects on expert learning but the effects may not be seen immediately after learning.

#!We present a method for progressive deforming meshes. Most existing mesh decimation methods focus on static meshes. However, there are more and more animation data today, and it is important to address the problem of simplifying deforming meshes. Our method is based on deformation oriented decimation (DOD) error metric and dynamic connectivity updating (DCU) algorithm. Deformation oriented decimation extends the deformation sensitivity decimation (DSD) error metric by augmenting an additional term to model the distortion introduced by deformation. This new metric preserves not only geometric features but also areas with large deformation. Using this metric, a static reference connectivity is extracted for the whole animation. Dynamic connectivity updating algorithm utilizes vertex trees to further reduce geometric distortion by allowing the connectivity to change. Temporal coherence in the dynamic connectivity between frames is achieved by penalizing large deviations from the reference connectivity. The combination of DOD and DCU demonstrates better simplification and triangulation performance than previous methods for deforming mesh simplification.

#*Multiple alignment by sequence annealing
#@Ariel S. Schwartz,Lior Pachter

#index1645
#!Motivation: We introduce a novel approach to multiple alignment that is based on an algorithm for rapidly checking whether single matches are consistent with a partial multiple alignment. This leads to a sequence annealing algorithm, which is an incremental method for building multiple sequence alignments one match at a time. Our approach improves significantly on the standard progressive alignment approach to multiple alignment. Results: The sequence annealing algorithm performs well on benchmark test sets of protein sequences. It is not only sensitive, but also specific, drastically reducing the number of incorrectly aligned residues in comparison to other programs. The method allows for adjustment of the sensitivity/specificity tradeoff and can be used to reliably identify homologous regions among protein sequences. Availability: An implementation of the sequence annealing algorithm is available at http://bio.math.berkeley.edu/amap/ Contact: sariel@cs.berkeley.edu

#!Scheduling a program (i.e. constructing a timetable for the execution of its operations) is one of the most powerful methods for automatic parallelization. A schedule gives a blueprint for constructing a synchronous program, suitable for an ASIC or VLIW processor. However, constructing a schedule entails solving a large linear program. Even if one accepts the (experimental) fact that the Simplex is almost always polynomial, the scheduling time is of the order of a large power of the program size. Hence, the method does not scale well. The present paper proposes two methods for improving the situation. First, a large program can be divided into smaller units (processes), which can be scheduled separately. This is structured scheduling. Second, one can use projection methods for solving linear programs incrementally. This is specially efficient if the dependence graph is sparse.

#!e is a programming language designed for modeling and verification of electronic systems. As such it is used extensively in the microchip industry, and was recently declared an IEEE standard, e is also a powerful general-purpose language used in the implementation of complex commercial software tools.It was suggested some time ago that a number of idioms in e resemble those of AOP, but the suggestion was never examined in depth. The present paper takes up this task. For this purpose the relevant mechanisms in e are compared with those of today's prominent aspect-oriented language - AspectJ - with respect to syntax, semantics, and application.e's aspect-oriented capabilities turn out to be a small subset of AspectJ's, but an interesting one. It is weaker in its support for implementing developmental and non-functional concerns. However, with its simpler syntax and economical semantics, e captures in a natural way crosscutting concerns that stem from the application domain. Thus, e seems to exemplify an original variant of AOP - one that is conservative and robust from a software design point of view.

#!E-Commerce technologies are interactive in nature, yet most research on E-Commerce adoption and use fails to consider this feature and the technology's social context of use in its theorizing. In this paper, we seek to theorize the technological feature of interactivity in a social context of information asymmetry by studying the use of E-Commerce technology among car sales associates in the US. Drawing on Social Exchange Theory (Kelley, 1979), we develop a model of interactive technology use that incorporates the user's beliefs about his/her exchange partner, the user's attitude toward technology use and the technology's perceived usefulness for the work process it is impacting. After refining our model with insights gained from observations of and interviews with a few car sales associates, we then test our contextualized model of E-Commerce use with data collected from a national survey of car sales associates (n=137).Our results show that attitude and users' beliefs about their exchange partners improve our ability to predict IT use. Furthermore, the contexualization of TAM highlights the theory's assumptions about the unemotional and individually-focused nature of users' decision making with respect to IT use.

#!Graph bandwidth minimization (GBM) is a classical and challenging problem in graph algorithms and combinatorial optimization. Most of existing researches on this problem have focused on unweighted graphs. In this paper, we study the bandwidth minimization problem of weighted caterpillars, and propose several algorithms for solving various types of caterpillars and general graphs. More specifically, we show that the GBM problem on caterpillars with hair-length at most 2 and the GBM problem on star-shape caterpillars are NP-complete, and give a lower bound of the graph bandwidth for general weighted graphs. For caterpillars with hair-length at most 1, we present an O(n log n log(nwmax))-time algorithm to compute an optimal bandwidth layout, where n is the total number of vertices in the graph and wmax is the maximum wedge weight. For caterpillars with hair-length at most k, we give a k-approximation algorithm. For arbitrary caterpillars and general graphs, we give a heuristic algorithm and some experimental results. Experiments show that the solutions obtained by our heuristic algorithm are roughly within a factor of clog(n) of the lower bound for a small number c, which is consistent with the inapproximability results of this problem (i.e., no constant approximation for the GBM problem unless P = NP).

#!A framework is provided for evaluation of packet delay distribution in an optical circuit-switched network. The framework is based on a fluid traffic model, packet queueing at edge routers, and circuit-switched transmission between edge routers. Packets are assigned to buffers according to their destination, delay constraint, physical route and wavelength. At every decision epoch, a subset of buffers is allocated to end-to-end circuits for transmission, where circuit holding times are based on limited and exhaustive circuit allocation policies. To ensure computational tractability, the framework approximates the evolution of each buffer independently. "Slack variables" are introduced to decouple amongst buffers in a way that the evolution of each buffer remains consistent with all other buffers in the network. The delay distribution is derived for a single buffer and an approximation is given for a network of buffers. The approximation entails finding a fixed point for the functional relation between the "slack variables" and a specific circuit allocation policy. An analysis of a specific policy, in which circuits are probabilistically allocated based on buffer size, is given as an illustrative example. The framework is shown to be in good agreement with a discrete event simulation model.

#!One of the typical causes of errors in team cooperative activities, such as in central control rooms of power plants and cockpits in aircrafts, is conflicts among team members' intentions. If mutual awareness and communication were perfectly established and maintained, conflicts could be detected and recovered by team members; however, this does not happen in practice. In this paper, we provide a framework for detecting conflicts among team members' intentions based on team intention inference, aiming to make machines function as a coordinator for cooperative activities. In previous work, we developed a method for team intention inference based on a definition of 'we-intention'. We-intention is other-regarding intentions relating to situations in which some agents act together, and is represented as a set of individual intentions and mutual beliefs. In this framework, a conflict can be defined as a set of individual intentions and false beliefs (undesired procedures), and detected by searching for such combinations. We applied the proposed method to the operation of a plant simulator operated by a two-person team, and it was confirmed through an experiment that this method could list candidates for conflicts by type and set the actual conflict high in priority in the tested context.

#index1703
#!A dynamic Bayesian network (DBN) is a probabilistic network that models interdependent entities that change over time. Given example sequences of multivariate data, we use a genetic algorithm to synthesize a network structure that models the causal relationships that explain the sequence. We use a multi-objective evaluation strategy with a genetic algorithm. The multi-objective criteria are a network's probabilistic score and structural complexity score. Our use of Pareto ranking is ideal for this application, because it naturally balances the effect of the likelihood and structural simplicity terms used in the BIC network evaluation heuristic. We use a basic structural scoring formula, which tries to keep the number of links in the network approximately equivalent to the number of variables. We also use a simple representation that favors sparsely connected networks similar in structure to those modeling biological phenomenon. Our experiments show promising results when evolving networks ranging from 10 to 30 variables, using a maximal connectivity of between 3 and 4 parents per node. The results from the multi-objective GA were superior to those obtained with a single objective GA.

#!We present a hyper-interaction platform which integrates several newly developed techniques, including motion classification, a motion reaction control mechanism and a high precision 3-D model of the International Space Station. The goal is to build an interaction platform for trainers to navigate in a virtual reality. The platform can be applied to customized mission training. The system integrated visualization environment, underlying 3-D model, and a human body tracking mechanism. The tracking system will be extended to 3-D coordination reconstruction and thus behaviors of users can be precisely identified. These navigation parameters are used in controlling navigation in the 3-D virtual environment. Another important issue of this system is to define a model for motion reaction. The definition of reaction can be applied to avatars or to the virtual environment. These integrated technologies can also be used in other virtual reality environments.

#!We present a method for scattered data approximation with subdivision surfaces which actually uses the true representation of the limit surface as a linear combination of smooth basis functions associated with the control vertices. This is unlike previous techniques which used only piecewise linear approximations of the limit surface. By this we can assign arbitrary parameterizations to the given sample points, including those generated by parameter correction. We present a robust and fast algorithm for exact closest point search on Loop surfaces by combining Newton iteration and non-linear minimization. Based on this we perform unconditionally convergent parameter correction to optimize the approximation with respect to the L2 metric and thus we make a well-established scattered data fitting technique which has been available before only for B-spline surfaces, applicable to subdivision surfaces. Further we exploit the fact that the control mesh of a subdivision surface can have arbitrary connectivity to reduce the L&infin; error up to a certain user-defined tolerance by adaptively restructuring the control mesh. By employing iterative least squares solvers, we achieve acceptable running times even for large amounts of data and we obtain high quality approximations by surfaces with relatively low control mesh complexity compared to the number of sample points. Since we are using plain subdivision surfaces, there is no need for multiresolution detail coefficients and we do not have to deal with the additional overhead in data and computational complexity associated with them.

#!ID-SP-M4M scheme means ID-based series-parallel multisignature schemes for multi-messages. In this paper, we investigate series-parallel multisignature schemes for multi-messages and propose an ID-SP-M4M scheme based on pairings in which signers in the same subgroup sign the same message, and those in different subgroups sign different messages. Our new scheme is an improvement over the series-parallel multisignature schemes introduced by Doi et al. [6]--[8] and subsequent results such as the schemes proposed by Burmester et al. [4] and the original protocols proposed by Tada [20], [21], in which only one message is to be signed. Furthermore, our ID-SP-M4M scheme is secure against forgery signature attack from parallel insiders under the BDH assumption.

#cACM SIGNUM Newsletter
#index1743
#!Cramer's rule expresses the solution to a system of simultaneous linear equaations in terms of ratios of determinants. It is widely known as an example of an impractical method for large systems because of the time required to compute the determinants. For 2-by-2 systems this time difficulty disappears and, since the method does not involve a search for pivots, it may appear to have an advantage over Gaussian elimination. In fact, methods based upon 2-by-2 Cramer's rule have been proposed for use on parallel computers. In this note we wish to point out that Cramer's rule is unsatisfactory even for 2-by-2 systems because of roundoff error difficulties.

#*GPS/IMU data fusion using multisensor Kalman filtering: introduction of contextual aspects

#cInformation Fusion
#index1749
#!The aim of this article is to develop a GPS/IMU multisensor fusion algorithm, taking context into consideration. Contextual variables are introduced to define fuzzy validity domains of each sensor. The algorithm increases the reliability of the position information. A simulation of this algorithm is then made by fusing GPS and IMU data coming from real tests on a land vehicle. Bad data delivered by GPS sensor are detected and rejected using contextual information thus increasing reliability. Moreover, because of a lack of credibility of GPS signal in some cases and because of the drift of the INS, GPS/INS association is not satisfactory at the moment. In order to avoid this problem, the authors propose to feed the fusion process based on a multisensor Kalman filter directly with the acceleration provided by the IMU. Moreover, the filter developed here gives the possibility to easily add other sensors in order to achieve performances required.

#!The authors present uncomplicated and well established equations that can be used in simulation or real-world applications to determine key crossing points and aircraft proximity when the trajectory and speed of aircraft pairs are known. These equations, in closed form, were developed for computing the minimum distance between two aircraft within the four-dimensional (4D) space-time domain. The 4D flight proximity information can be used in simulation to evaluate large numbers of scheduled routes over a limited airspace for controller workload assessment. Also, it can be used to detect potential separation violations and impacts of traffic flow management (TFM) strategies. An example of computing the distance between two flights in 4D is presented. Sample aircraft proximity landscape in 4D space-time simulation with MATLAB code is also provided.

#!This paper addresses computational prediction of protein structural classes. Although in recent years progress in this field was made, the main drawback of the published prediction methods is a limited scope of comparison procedures, which in same cases were also improperly performed. Two examples include using protein datasets of varying homology, which has significant impact on the prediction accuracy, and comparing methods in pairs using different datasets. Based on extensive experimental work, the main aim of this paper is to revisit and reevaluate state of the art in this field. To this end, this paper performs a first-of-its-kind comprehensive and multi-goal study, which includes investigation of eight prediction algorithms, three protein sequence representations, three datasets with different homologies and finally three test procedures. Quality of several previously unused prediction algorithms, newly proposed sequence representation, and a new-to-the-field testing procedure is evaluated. Several important conclusions and findings are made. First, the logistic regression classifier, which was not previously used, is shown to perform better than other prediction algorithms, and high quality of previously used support vector machines is confirmed. The results also show that the proposed new sequence representation improves accuracy of the high quality prediction algorithms, while it does not improve results of the lower quality classifiers. The study shows that commonly used jackknife test is computationally expensive, and therefore computationally less demanding 10-fold cross-validation procedure is proposed. The results show that there is no statistically significant difference between these two procedures. The experiments show that sequence homology has very significant impact on the prediction accuracy, i.e. using highly homologous datasets results in higher accuracies. Thus, results of several past studies that use homologous datasets should not be perceived as reliable. The best achieved prediction accuracy for low homology datasets is about 57% and confirms results reported by Wang and Yuan [How good is the prediction of protein structural class by the component-coupled method?. Proteins 2000;38:165-175]. For a highly homologous dataset instance based classification is shown to be better than the previously reported results. It achieved 97% prediction accuracy demonstrating that homology is a major factor that can result in the overestimated prediction accuracy.

#!In secure group communications, the time cost associated with key updates in the events of member join and departure is an important aspect of quality of service, especially in large groups with highly dynamic membership. To achieve better time efficiency, we propose a join-exit-tree (JET) key management framework. First, a special key tree topology with join and exit subtrees is introduced to handle key updates for dynamic membership. Then, optimization techniques are employed to determine the capacities of join and exit subtrees for achieving the best time efficiency, and algorithms are designed to dynamically update the join and exit trees. We show that, on average, the asymptotic time cost for each member join/departure event is reduced to O(log (log n)) from the previous cost of O(log n), where n is the group size. Our experimental results based on simulated user activities as well as the real MBone data demonstrate that the proposed JET scheme can significantly improve the time efficiency, while maintaining low communication and computation cost, of tree-based contributory key management.

#*Perl Best Practices
#@Damian Conway
#t2005
#c
#index1765
#!Many programmers code by instinct, relying on convenient habits or a "style" they picked up early on. They aren't conscious of all the choices they make, like how they format their source, the names they use for variables, or the kinds of loops they use. They're focused entirely on problems they're solving, solutions they're creating, and algorithms they're implementing. So they write code in the way that seems natural, that happens intuitively, and that feels good. But if you're serious about your profession, intuition isn't enough. Perl Best Practices author Damian Conway explains that rules, conventions, standards, and practices not only help programmers communicate and coordinate with one another, they also provide a reliable framework for thinking about problems, and a common language for expressing solutions. This is especially critical in Perl, because the language is designed to offer many ways to accomplish the same task, and consequently it supports many incompatible dialects.With a good dose of Aussie humor, Dr. Conway (familiar to many in the Perl community) offers 256 guidelines on the art of coding to help you write better Perl code--in fact, the best Perl code you possibly can. The guidelines cover code layout, naming conventions, choice of data and control structures, program decomposition, interface design and implementation, modularity, object orientation, error handling, testing, and debugging.They're designed to work together to produce code that is clear, robust, efficient, maintainable, and concise, but Dr. Conway doesn't pretend that this is the one true universal and unequivocal set of best practices. Instead, Perl Best Practices offers coherent and widely applicable suggestions based on real-world experience of how code is actually written, rather than on someone's ivory-tower theories on how software ought to be created.Most of all, Perl Best Practices offers guidelines that actually work, and that many developers around the world are already using. Much like Perl itself, these guidelines are about helping you to get your job done, without getting in the way.Praise for Perl Best Practices from Perl community members:"As a manager of a large Perl project, I'd ensure that every member of my team has a copy of Perl Best Practices on their desk, and use it as the basis for an in-house style guide." -- Randal Schwartz"There are no more excuses for writing bad Perl programs. All levels of Perl programmer will be more productive after reading this book." -- Peter Scott"Perl Best Practices will be the next big important book in the evolution of Perl. The ideas and practices Damian lays down will help bring Perl out from under the embarrassing heading of "scripting languages". Many of us have known Perl is a real programming language, worthy of all the tasks normally delegated to Java and C++. With Perl Best Practices, Damian shows specifically how and why, so everyone else can see, too." -- Andy Lester"Damian's done what many thought impossible: show how to build large, maintainable Perl applications, while still letting Perl be the powerful, expressive language that programmers have loved for years." -- Bill Odom"Finally, a means to bring lasting order to the process and product of real Perl development teams." -- Andrew Sundstrom "Perl Best Practices provides a valuable education in how to write robust, maintainable Perl, and is a definitive citation source when coaching other programmers." -- Bennett Todd "I've been teaching Perl for years, and find the same question keeps being asked: Where can I find a reference for writing reusable, maintainable Perl code? Finally I have a decent answer." -- Paul Fenwick "At last a well researched, well thought-out, comprehensive guide to Perl style. Instead of each of us developing our own, we can learn good practices from one of Perl's most prolific and experienced authors. I recommend this book to anyone who prefers getting on with the job rather than going back and fixing errors caused by syntax and poor style issues." -- Jacinta Richardson "If you care about programming in any language read this book. Even if you don't intend to follow all of the practices, thinking through your style will improve it." -- Steven Lembark "The Perl community's best author is back with another outstanding book. There has never been a comprehensive reference on high quality Perl coding and style until Perl Best Practices. This book fills a large gap in every Perl bookshelf." -- Uri Guttman

#!Legendre orthogonal moments have been widely used in the field of image analysis. Because their computation by a direct method is very time expensive, recent efforts have been devoted to the reduction of computational complexity. Nevertheless, the existing algorithms are mainly focused on binary images. We propose here a new fast method for computing the Legendre moments, which is not only suitable for binary images but also for grey level images. We first establish a recurrence formula of one-dimensional (1D) Legendre moments by using the recursive property of Legendre polynomials. As a result, the 1D Legendre moments of order p, L"p=L"p(0), can be expressed as a linear combination of L"p"-"1(1) and L"p"-"2(0). Based on this relationship, the 1D Legendre moments L"p(0) can thus be obtained from the arrays of L"1(a) and L"0(a), where a is an integer number less than p. To further decrease the computation complexity, an algorithm, in which no multiplication is required, is used to compute these quantities. The method is then extended to the calculation of the two-dimensional Legendre moments L"p"q. We show that the proposed method is more efficient than the direct method.

#!A data stream is a potentially uninterrupted flow of data. Mining this flow makes it necessary to cope with uncertainty, as only a part of the stream can be stored. In this paper, we evaluate a statistical technique which biases the estimation of the support of patterns, so as to maximize either the precision or the recall, as chosen by the user, and limit the degradation of the other criterion. Theoretical results show that the technique is not far from the optimum, from the statistical standpoint. Experiments performed tend to demonstrate its potential, as it remains robust even under significant distribution drifts.

#*On the expressive power of semi-normal defaults in some semantic variants of default logic

#!Normality, semi-normality and prerequisite-freedom are examples of syntactic restrictions proposed for defaults. The expressive powers of Reiter's default logic under the corresponding syntactic restrictions have been analyzed by Janhunen. It is quite natural that to ask if such restrictions affect the expressive power of variants of default logic. In this paper we analyze the expressive powers of semi-normal (SN) variants of Lukaszewicz's default logic (LDL). Among another variants of default logic are cumulative default logic (CDL) by Brewka as well as commitment to assumptions default logic and quasi-default logic (CADL and QDL) by Giordano and Martelli. The expressive powers of these three variants under the corresponding syntactic restrictions are also investigated. The framework is based on the notion of Janhunen's polynomial, faithful and modular (PFM) translation function that maps systematically theories of one nonmonotonic logic to theories of other such that the semantics of theories is preserved. The criteria for evaluating expressive powers of nonmonotonic logics are existence/nonexistence of PFM translations between such nonmonotonic logics. According to the measure provided by PFM translation we point out that semi-normality, in general (allowing defaults possessing no consistency conditions) may decrease expressive power of defaults in LDL and prove that semi-normality does not affect expressiveness of defaults in LDL *(where defaults have at least one consistency condition). For assertion default theories, expressive power may decrease in certain DL variants if syntactic resections (such as semi-normality) are introduced. The reason why such anomalies arise is that consistency conditions of applied defaults are recorded in the support of extensions. To deal with this problem we introduce a weaker notion of PFM translation function, called quasi-PFM translation function (QPFM). According to the measure provided by QPFM translations we analyze expressive powers of semi-normal defaults in CDL, CADL and QDL and establish that, in CDL and QDL, semi-normality does not affect expressiveness of defaults yet. For CADL, unfortunately, semi-normal defaults are less expressive than general defaults even if we adopt a weaker notion of faithfulness than one by Janhunen. Noticing that arbitrary consistency conditions (including empty consistency condition) are allowed for LDL, CADL and QDL, we also consider the possibility of reducing multiple consistency conditions to a single consistency condition.

#!Existing work on animation synthesis can be roughly split into two approaches, those that combine segments of motion-capture data, and those that perform inverse kinematics. In this paper, we present a method for performing animation synthesis of an articulated object (e.g. human body and a dog) from a minimal set of body joint positions, following the approach of inverse kinematics. We tackle this problem from a learning perspective. Firstly, we address the need for knowledge on the physical constraints of the articulated body, so as to avoid the generation of a physically impossible poses. A common solution is to heuristically specify the kinematic constraints for the skeleton model. In this paper however, the physical constraints of the articulated body are represented using a hierarchical cluster model learnt from a motion capture database. Additionally, we shall show that the learnt model automatically captures the correlation between different joints through simultaneous modelling of their angles. We then show how this model can be utilised to perform inverse kinematics in a simple and efficient manner. Crucially, we describe how IK is carried out from a minimal set of end-effector positions. Following this, we show how this "learnt inverse kinematics" framework can be used to perform animation syntheses on different types of articulated structures. To this end, the results presented include the retargeting of a flat surface walking animation to various uneven terrains to demonstrate the synthesis of a full human body motion from the positions of only the hands, feet and torso. Additionally, we show how the same method can be applied to the animation synthesis of a dog using only its feet and torso positions.

#!This discussion presents a new perspective of subspace independent component analysis (ICA). The notion of a function of cumulants (kurtosis) is generalized to vector kurtosis. This vector kurtosis is utilized in the subspace ICA algorithm to estimate subspace independent components. One of the main advantages of the presented approach is its computational simplicity. The experiments have shown promising results in estimating subspace independent components.

#!In cellular networks, an important practical issue is how to limit the handoff dropping probability efficiently. One possible approach is to perform dynamic bandwidth reservation based on mobility predictions. With the rapid advances in mobile positioning technology, and the widespread availability of digital road maps previously designed for navigational devices, we propose a predictive bandwidth reservation scheme built upon these timely opportunities. In contrast to the common practice of utilizing only incoming handoff predictions at each cell to compute the reservations, our scheme is more efficient as it innovatively utilizes both incoming and outgoing handoff predictions; it can meet the same target handoff dropping probability by blocking fewer new calls. The individual base stations are responsible for the computations, which are shown to be simple enough to be performed in real-time. We evaluate the scheme via simulation, along with five other schemes for comparison. Simulation results show that those schemes that rely on positioning information are significantly more efficient than those that do not. Our scheme's additional use of the road topology information further improves upon this advantage, bringing the efficiency closer to the bound set by a benchmark scheme that assumes perfect knowledge about future handoffs.

#index1856
#!We present the use of a Modified Generalized Hough Transform (MGHT) and deformable contours for image data retrieval where a given contour, gray-scale, or color template image can be detected in the target image, irrespective of its position, size, rotation, and smooth deformation transformations. Potential template positions are found in the target image using our novel modified Generalized Hough Transform method that takes measurements from the template features by extending a line from each edge contour point in its gradient direction to the other end of the object. The gradient difference is used to create a relationship with the orientation and length of this line segment. Potential matching positions in the target image are then searched by also extending a line from each target edge point to another end along the normal, then looking up the measurements data from the template image. Positions with high votes become candidate positions. Each candidate position is used to find a match by allowing the template to undergo a contour transformation. The deformed template contour is matched with the target by measuring the similarity in contour tangent direction and the smoothness of the matching vector. The deformation parameters are then updated via a Bayesian algorithm to find the best match. To avoid getting stuck in a local minimum solution, a novel coarse-and-fine model for contour matching is included. Results are presented for real images of several kinds including bin picking and fingerprint identification.

#!Four algorithms, all variants of Simultaneous Perturbation Stochastic Approximation (SPSA), are proposed. The original one-measurement SPSA uses an estimate of the gradient of objective function L containing an additional bias term not seen in two-measurement SPSA. As a result, the asymptotic covariance matrix of the iterate convergence process has a bias term. We propose a one-measurement algorithm that eliminates this bias, and has asymptotic convergence properties making for easier comparison with the two-measurement SPSA. The algorithm, under certain conditions, outperforms both forms of SPSA with the only overhead being the storage of a single measurement. We also propose a similar algorithm that uses perturbations obtained from normalized Hadamard matrices. The convergence w.p. 1 of both algorithms is established. We extend measurement reuse to design two second-order SPSA algorithms and sketch the convergence analysis. Finally, we present simulation results on an illustrative minimization problem.

#!The lack of appropriate alternative text for web images remains a problem for blind users and others accessing the web with non-visual interfaces. The content contained within web images is vital for understanding many web sites but the majority are assigned either inaccurate alternative text or none at all. The capability to automatically judge the quality of alternative text has the promise to dramatically improve the accessibility of the web by bringing intelligence to three categories of interfaces: tools that help web authors verify that they have provided adequate alternative text for web images, systems that automatically produce and insert alternative text for web images, and screen reading software. In this paper we describe a classifier capable of measuring the quality of alternative text given only a few labeled training examples by automatically considering the image context.

#!K42 is one of the few recent research projects that is examining operating system design structure issues in the context of new whole-system design. K42 is open source and was designed from the ground up to perform well and to be scalable, customizable, and maintainable. The project was begun in 1996 by a team at IBM Research. Over the last nine years there has been a development effort on K42 from between six to twenty researchers and developers across IBM, collaborating universities, and national laboratories. K42 supports the Linux API and ABI, and is able to run unmodified Linux applications and libraries. The approach we took in K42 to achieve scalability and customizability has been successful.The project has produced positive research results, has resulted in contributions to Linux and the Xen hypervisor on Power, and continues to be a rich platform for exploring system software technology. Today, K42, is one of the key exploratory platforms in the DOE's FAST-OS program, is being used as a prototyping vehicle in IBM's PERCS project, and is being used by universities and national labs for exploratory research. In this paper, we provide insight into building an entire system by discussing the motivation and history of K42, describing its fundamental technologies, and presenting an overview of the research directions we have been pursuing.

#!Progress in reconfigurable hardware technology allows the implementation of complete SoCs in today's FPGAs. In the context design for reliability, software checkpointing is an effective methodology to cope with faults. In this paper, we systematically extend the concept of checkpointing known from software systems to hardware tasks running on reconfigurable devices. We will classify different mechanisms for hardware checkpointing and present formulas for estimating the hardware overhead. Moreover, we will reveal a tool that takes over the burden of modifying hardware modules for checkpointing. Post-synthesis results of applying our methodology to different hardware accelerators will be presented and the results will be compared with the theoretical estimations.

#!In recent years, overlay networks have proven a popular way of disseminating potentially large files from a single server S to a potentially large group of N end users via the Internet. A number of algorithms and protocols have been suggested, implemented and studied. In particular, much attention has been given to peer-to-peer (P2P) systems such as BitTorrent [5], Slurpie [20], SplitStream [4], Bullet [11] and Avalanche [6]. The key idea is that the file is divided into M parts of equal size and that a given user may download any one of these - or, for Avalanche, linear combinations of these - either from the server or from a peer who has previously downloaded it.

#!In this paper, we present a subdivision-inspired scheme to construct generalized Sierpinski polyhedron. Unlike usual Sierpinski polyhedra construction schemes, which create either an infinite set of disconnected tetrahedra or a non-manifold polyhedron, our robust construction scheme creates one connected and manifold polyhedron. Moreover, unlike the original schemes, this new scheme can be applied to any manifold polyhedral mesh and based on the shape of this initial polyhedra a large variety of Sierpinski polyhedra can be obtained. Our basic scheme can be viewed as applying simplest subdivision scheme [23] to an input polyhedron, but retaining old vertices. The porous structure is then obtained by removing the refined facets of the simplest subdivision.

#!Comb-drive microactuator is widely used in MEMS devices and traditionally is made of silicon as structural material using silicon-based fabrication technology. Recent development in UV lithography of SU-8 has made it possible to fabricate the ultra high aspect ratio microstructures with excellent sidewall quality. In this paper, we report a low cost alternative to the silicon-based comb drive by using cured SU-8 polymer as structural material. The microactuator was designed to have a integrated structure without assembly or bonding. A unique integration fabrication process was successfully developed based on UV lithography of SU-8 and selectively metallizing SU-8 polymer structures. Preliminary experimental results have proved the feasibility of the microactuator and the fabrication technology.

#!Certain business objectives cannot be met without the interaction and communication between different systems. An interesting concept called system of systems (SoS), which aims to describe this interaction between systems has been gaining attention in the last few years. In this paper an extensive review of the literature is performed to capture the main characteristics associated to this concept in order to propose a new, more complete definition. This paper also proposes the use of distributed simulation through the High Level Architecture (HLA) rules to model and simulate systems of systems. We illustrate our idea with two different examples, a simplified supply chain network of a computer assembly and an aircraft initial sizing scenarios. The paper concludes with a discussion of some of the significant advantages distributed simulation could offer over traditional simulation for the analysis of such complex systems.

#!Stock allocation in a distribution supply chain (DSC) means that the warehouse has to determine quantities of the available stock to be delivered to each retailer. Different allocation rules have been developed with various aims. In this paper, a new fuzzy-logic-based decision-making system for stock allocation (DMS&lowbar;SA) is presented, and the objective is to achieve the target DSC fill rate whilst incurring an acceptable total holding cost, or to achieve the target holding cost whilst with a certain level of fill rate. It is shown how DMS&lowbar;SA can be extended to be applied to a multi-echelon DSC. Copyright &copy; 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

#!Time-harmonic electromagnetic scattering by inhomogeneous, three-dimensional structures within a free space environment can be described by electric- and magnetic field, volume integral equations involving the free space Green function. A comprehensive set of Galerkin projection formulations (also known as moment methods) for the numerical solution of these equations is presented, together with comparative numerical results. Such formulations are widely used for particle scattering analysis, optical near field calculation, etc. Results are obtained with higher-order, divergence-and curl-conforming basis functions on iso-parametric, tetrahedral meshes. The results demonstrate that all formulations converge with similar accuracy in the case of an analytically-solvable test problem. When modeling flux densities as solution variables, it is argued that solenoidal function spaces should be used, rather than the standard divergence-conforming function spaces; this assertion is supported by the results. Some of the formulations involve solving for curl-conforming fields; such fields can be discretized with fewer unknowns than divergence-conforming ones, implying lower computational costs. Additionally, some formulations yield system matrices which are approximately halfway sparse, meaning that computational costs will be down by a factor of 2 when iterative solvers are employed, which is the case for the widely-used fast methods.

These cutting planes subsume or dominate many of those proposed earlier, and are easier to generate. When used in a branch and bound context, they yield stronger bounds than the ones currently in use.

#*The operational risk tree methodology for managing operational risk exposure and measuring capital requirements
#@Henry Lee
#t2006
#cProceedings of the 38th conference on Winter simulation
#index1924
#!Monte Carlo simulation is applied to measuring operational risk via a modified decision tree. The author describes a simulation based approach to measuring economic and regulatory capital for operational risk. Except in relatively rare cases where sufficient data exists, quantitative operational risk has grown to depend upon expert opinion via scenario analysis to fill in the missing data. The author explains the limitations and shortcomings of the current approach and details an alternative approach using a modified decision tree to address many of these shortcomings. While in the absence of data we still depend upon expert opinion, there is good reason to believe that the method of collecting this opinion can have great impact upon the confidence in, and reproducibility of, the results.

#!Diffusions of new products and technologies through social networks can be formalized as spreading of infectious diseases. However, while epidemiological models describe infection in terms of transmissibility, we propose a diffusion model that explicitly includes consumer decision-making affected by social influences and word-of-mouth processes. In our agent-based model consumers' probability of adoption depends on the external marketing effort and on the internal influence that each consumer perceives in his/her personal networks. Maintaining a given marketing effort and assuming its effect on the probability of adoption as linear, we can study how social processes affect diffusion dynamics and how the speed of the diffusion depends on the network structure and on consumer heterogeneity. First, we show that the speed of diffusion changes with the degree of randomness in the network. In markets with high social influence and in which consumers have a sufficiently large local network, the speed is low in regular networks, it increases in small-world networks and, contrarily to what epidemic models suggest, it becomes very low again in random networks. Second, we show that heterogeneity helps the diffusion. Ceteris paribus and varying the degree of heterogeneity in the population of agents simulation results show that the more heterogeneous the population, the faster the speed of the diffusion. These results can contribute to the development of marketing strategies for the launch and the dissemination of new products and technologies, especially in turbulent and fashionable markets.
